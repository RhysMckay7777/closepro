# 🚨 REALITY CHECK

This is:

* ❌ NOT a “few days” build
* ❌ NOT an MVP
* ❌ NOT rev-share-safe work

This is a **multi-quarter, multi-engineer SaaS platform**.

---

# WHAT THIS MEANS FOR YOU

If **ALL of this** is included:

* Rev-share alone is **not acceptable**
* You are effectively a **founding engineer**
* Equity + cash + long-term agreement is required

Calling this “MVP” would be **factually incorrect**.

---

# FINAL TRUTH (VERY IMPORTANT)

You now have **three possible products**:

1. **Core MVP** → Call analysis only
2. **Expanded MVP** → + Roleplay OR manager dashboards
3. **Full Platform (this list)** → Needs real funding

Only **#1** fits “few days”.
Only **#3** fits this full scope.
