1
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.020
Zoom user: Hello, can you hear me?


2
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.709
Connor Williams: Hey, there we go, I can hear you, I just can't see you yet.


3
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.420
Zoom user: I'll wait one moment.


4
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.400
Zoom user: Oh, maybe no?


5
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.430
Connor Williams: Yeah, there we go. How's it going, bud? You all good?


6
00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.270
Zoom user: All good, yeah, all good.


7
00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:26.760
Connor Williams: Good.


8
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.289
Zoom user: I'm sorry, we had to head this meeting before, but I had some issues.


9
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:42.480
Connor Williams: Yeah, no, that's absolutely fine, I got your message, so, yeah, good to be on, man. But tell me, how much have you seen so far? Because I know you've obviously had a conversation with the other Connor.


10
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:54.850
Connor Williams: He shared a bit more about his journey, which is, you know, so nice to see someone who is actually going through, kind of, step by step. But, yeah, how much have you seen so far about what I do specifically, and high-ticket closing?


11
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.790
Zoom user: I mean, I saw the… I saw the videos from the… from the link.


12
00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.560
Connor Williams: Yeah.


13
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:12.950
Zoom user: I think I quite seen all of them, I think, yes, almost all of them. I'm not gonna lie, I don't really have any clue what this high ticket sales is about, I don't really know. I think it's the…


14
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.680
Zoom user: I'm not sure if the first time, but for sure the second time, when I hear about it, I didn't.


15
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.210
Connor Williams: Yeah.


16
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.380
Zoom user: I didn't know about it before.


17
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.619
Connor Williams: And did you watch that video about what high-ticket closing is? It's about 6 or 7 minutes long?


18
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.780
Zoom user: Yeah, yeah, I watched a video that was long, yeah, but still, I'm a bit, you know…


19
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:45.890
Connor Williams: Well, to be honest with you, it's quite a simple model. So, past what we kind of broke down in that video, you know, you sell independently as an entrepreneur, you're not an employee, so you get a lot more freedom. It is completely remote, so you can do it from wherever, with a laptop.


20
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:56.640
Connor Williams: But it's obviously high-level sales, so you need those skills to be able to do it effectively, but we find businesses that sell 5K to 25K online digital products.


21
00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:07.789
Connor Williams: We take a closing call, which is just kind of like one call with someone. We usually sell about 1 in every 3 people, and then we take our 10% commission, of everything that we sell. But…


22
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:25.620
Connor Williams: you know, getting into that space is obviously, like I said, the skills need to be there to be able to sell effectively, be able to find these offers, who to sell for, all of that good stuff, but that's where someone like myself comes in. But rather than, you know, rather than just kind of a course that will teach you all these things.


23
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.330
Connor Williams: I do prefer to run a little bit more as a mentor, so…


24
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:47.060
Connor Williams: It is great to teach someone sales skills, but when it comes to what people actually want, which is, you know, the freedom to work for themselves, to be successful entrepreneurs, I've always found that a lot of that comes into the mindset side as well, you know, having someone that can support you, share their journey, you know, I've come from


25
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.209
Connor Williams: A long time in corporate.


26
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:56.459
Connor Williams: It took me 5 years of trying different online business models before I was, you know, making 10K a month, you know, working for myself, all those things.


27
00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.039
Connor Williams: So, you know, I speak for a lot of experience, but…


28
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:08.310
Connor Williams: The main thing, like I said, I want to get someone to a really good place, so it'd be good to understand a bit more about yourself, what you're kind of doing now, where that fits in with this.


29
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:27.609
Connor Williams: more importantly, where you want to go with this, and if it's something I can help you to do. If it is, then I'll be able to break down the program, how everything works, and then look, if you honestly love it, you think this is the thing that's going to absolutely change your life, then we could even explore getting set up today. But, you know, tell me, what's kind of brought you onto the call with me and looking into things like high-ticket closing?


30
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:40.549
Zoom user: our… I saw it on corner, and anyway, I know that, you know, the entire world is heading to the internet way, you know, I mean? I mean, it's obvious that we are… we are heading there.


31
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:57.409
Zoom user: And I know him from, I don't know, 2022 something, you know, and I've been seeing his posts from, like, one year ago, this 6 months, whatever, you know, and I never asked him, actually, but I kept seeing him doing something, something, something. I was like, hmm, okay.


32
00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:10.699
Zoom user: And then, a few days ago, I asked him, and I think I heard about this high ticket selling before, but I never really looked for it. You know, there's a lot of scams online, and…


33
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:27.859
Zoom user: I don't know, I took a lot of scams myself with courses, trainings, and then I know Connor, I know him, like, physically, you know, I met him with… and I was like, okay, just tell me about it, you know, like… and I come from the same background as him. I was sailing as well, I don't want to sail anymore.


34
00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.930
Zoom user: I'm…


35
00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.649
Connor Williams: Are you still doing it at the moment?


36
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:32.640
Zoom user: No.


37
00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.109
Connor Williams: And what are you doing, kind of, day-to-day at the moment?


38
00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:44.179
Zoom user: I have some money that I had, you know, and then I'm posting on YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, I have a YouTube channel, this is what I do day to day now.


39
00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:46.390
Zoom user: Okay, nice. Just growing it.


40
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:52.290
Connor Williams: Yeah, and is… is that kind of giving you much of an income at the moment? Is it something that, you know, is.


41
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.009
Zoom user: It just started. It just started.


42
00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.890
Connor Williams: Okay, so…


43
00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:03.459
Connor Williams: What have we looked at so far, then? You mentioned you've actually done a few things already. What have we done so far?


44
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.200
Zoom user: In terms of what?


45
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.069
Connor Williams: You said that you tried a few online models before?


46
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:15.369
Zoom user: Yeah, so I did, in the beginning, I don't know, a few years ago, it was somewhere with dropshipping, but I never really…


47
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.790
Connor Williams: Yeah.


48
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:16.750
Zoom user: Hmm. No.


49
00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:33.100
Connor Williams: My first business was a dropshipping business, and I paid, like, 20 grand into that, and, you know, made about 500 quid. So, yeah, it was a tough one. It took me, like, 2 years to completely shut that one down as well. So, yeah, I can kind of understand that. So, what is it about high-ticket closing that kind of attracts you, then?


50
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:49.930
Zoom user: I like, you know, I like working with people, you know, the thing that I… not… I cannot say I regret it, but in the same time, I have a, you know, I chose to go to the… to go on ships when I have…


51
00:05:49.990 --> 00:06:00.959
Zoom user: I think I have… I can… I can always, have a good relationship with people, talk with people, I like people, you know, so then I'm like, fuck, I choose this when I'm looking at an engine, I'm like, what?


52
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.840
Zoom user: You know…


53
00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.180
Connor Williams: Yeah, yeah. And have you, have you done anything sales before? Like, any sales roles?


54
00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.089
Zoom user: I did, I did. Also, I'm,


55
00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:17.579
Zoom user: I'm managing a few businesses at home, in the online business, but, you know, I'm their ambassador, let's say.


56
00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.530
Connor Williams: So, we're not going to have a problem jumping on Zoom calls like this.


57
00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:22.740
Zoom user: No, no, no, no.


58
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.270
Connor Williams: But maybe some of, like, the sales skills as such, like.


59
00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:32.219
Connor Williams: Frameworks, objection handling, all that stuff. Is that something that we feel like we're probably missing?


60
00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:49.380
Zoom user: Maybe for the sales skills, I mean, I was managing when I… between 18 and 25, I think I was, my parents have a… I mean, it's not the same, I'm not saying it's the same, but they have a shop, you know, a market, so I was managing it from time to time, so…


61
00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:52.429
Zoom user: Yeah, I don't know if that counts, but…


62
00:06:52.750 --> 00:07:00.360
Connor Williams: Yeah. Well, you know, like I said, this space, the opportunity is absolutely huge, but I think a lot of people give


63
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:11.370
Connor Williams: a false impression of it. You know, they call it easy, you know, that's where people start to not trust that it's real, because someone says that you can make 10K a month with no experience in 3 months, and that's, you know, that's just not true.


64
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:12.860
Zoom user: No, obviously it's not easy.


65
00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:21.039
Connor Williams: Yeah, you have to really dedicate yourself to becoming highly skilled at sales, so much so that a business will pay you 10% of everything you bring in.


66
00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:39.399
Connor Williams: But, you know, the reason that a lot of people are here, because an online business, you have to focus on a thousand things. Here, you just have one thing to do, which is obviously, a lot better, but what do you actually feel like you want out of something like this, then? You know, what would be, like, the dream position that you would end up in if you got into high-ticket closing?


67
00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:42.019
Zoom user: So, the dream position that I'm in…


68
00:07:42.850 --> 00:08:00.209
Zoom user: I think, and I'm not gonna lie, everybody thinks about the money. I mean, you… you love… you love to deal with people, you love to do that. I mean, at the end of the day, you need money, so obviously the money is, like, a good motivation, let's call it like that. And then, my dream is, I… I started the YouTube channel before I…


69
00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:12.470
Zoom user: had any idea that I would want to quit sailing, and then I started posting, posting, posting. I took a break, because I went on the ship. I lost a lot, because the channel just got his momentum, like, you know.


70
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:16.540
Zoom user: And then, 4 months, nothing. Then it took me, like, now.


71
00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:23.470
Zoom user: 2 months and a half, three months and a half, to start building that momentum again. And then.


72
00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:38.309
Zoom user: I realized that, you know, I didn't… also, the YouTube channel, to be honest, I didn't start it, with money on my mind. I was making money already, so I was not, like, you know… but still, I was posting constantly, constantly. What I want to achieve. I want to continue posting.


73
00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:42.669
Zoom user: And I don't wanna… B, let's say.


74
00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:52.669
Zoom user: I mean, you can make money out of YouTube, yeah, that's fair, you know, but I don't want to be, like, restricted by anything, like, I need to go to the ship, I cannot film today, I'm…


75
00:08:52.890 --> 00:09:10.439
Zoom user: at work, like, you know, you know what I mean? It's one thing to work from your computer, whatever, it doesn't matter how many hours per day, it's fine. You can still record something after, before, it's fine. But if you are, I don't know, middle of the Atlantic Ocean, what can you… you know what I mean.


76
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.130
Connor Williams: Yeah.


77
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:21.279
Connor Williams: It's basically the freedom. This is what everybody… I think everybody wants, the freedom. Yeah, 100%. It's not even freedom. I've learned that there's something that sits beneath that, and it's control.


78
00:09:22.670 --> 00:09:23.470
Zoom user: Exactly, yeah.


79
00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:37.970
Connor Williams: in order to have freedom, you need to have control over your life. So, are we saying that if we got into closing and it gave us the income that we wanted to, we wouldn't have to go back on ships, we could do this, we could do our YouTube, we could actually stop doing the things that we want to do?


80
00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:39.310
Connor Williams: Alright, cool.


81
00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:39.650
Zoom user: Exactly.


82
00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:41.620
Connor Williams: Love that, man. Absolutely love that, but…


83
00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:48.139
Connor Williams: I suppose, like you said, money is a big part of that. What would you need to be doing a month in order to feel like you could do all those things?


84
00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:54.819
Zoom user: As much as possible. I mean, I don't have a… when it comes to that, I don't have a limit, you know, if you… a minimum amount for me.


85
00:09:54.820 --> 00:10:09.820
Zoom user: I don't know, I mean, you know, I live with less, I live with a lot, so, I mean, I don't think there is a bright amount that you can, I don't know, categorize it as good money. I think as much as possible, it's the, for me, at least, the best amount that you can have, I think.


86
00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:20.830
Connor Williams: Now, while I don't disagree with that, when it comes, you know, when it does come to entrepreneurship, when it comes to building businesses, or doing things like this, because essentially, you know, you are your own sales consultancy business.


87
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:23.710
Connor Williams: In order to get somewhere, you need to know where it is.


88
00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:42.249
Connor Williams: You need to know where it is, what the plan is, like, time frames. The more tangible you can get with that, the clearer a path you can build around it. It's what we do a lot in the mentorship, you know, we… I want to set goals, I want to see where you want to get to, I want to build a path between that. So, you know, and also, we need to make sure it's realistic.


89
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:51.249
Connor Williams: If you're hoping this can give you, like, 30, 40K a month in the first year, then, you know, this isn't going to be the right thing. So, let's stay in 6 months' time, then.


90
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:58.560
Connor Williams: Where ideally would we want to be in terms of earning a month from this in 6 months' time? Just so we can make sure it's even realistic, and we can get you there.


91
00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:06.670
Zoom user: To be fair, I have my YouTube channel from last year, and still, for today, I just now, I started in May.


92
00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:24.130
Zoom user: And just now, I… I'm starting to make some money, so then, obviously, I know that nothing comes, like, you know, you know how many videos I recorded? I… I… I worked, like, 12 hours to edit it, whatever, you know, then I have 100 views, so I know it's a… it's a path, you know, that you need to…


93
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:34.580
Zoom user: go step by step. So, realistically, I think in 6… I saw the testimonials, so everybody kind of started producing around,


94
00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:41.240
Zoom user: 2 months, 3 months, so probably in 6 months, I would say, You know.


95
00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:50.359
Zoom user: obviously, whenever I do something, I want to be the best. I want… I want to consider myself the best, so, you know, I'm… I'm all in to give…


96
00:11:50.360 --> 00:12:03.450
Zoom user: my 100%, you know, I don't… I'm not, I don't wanna sound bad, but I'm not in that generation, you know, where, if I sleep 2 hours this night, that's not fair, you know what I mean?


97
00:12:03.450 --> 00:12:07.910
Connor Williams: That's fine. I can give it my all in, like… How are the map?


98
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:08.990
Zoom user: 29.


99
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:14.230
Connor Williams: Okay, yeah, so I'm 34, so similar, yeah. We're not a soft generation.


100
00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:22.169
Zoom user: No, no, no, no, I'm not, you know, I don't really care, I can't do it fully, it's fine. And in 6 months, I would, I would say.


101
00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:40.240
Zoom user: I'm not sure about the amount, because I don't really know much about the industry, you know, but I would say the entry amount that you can do that can, let's say, fulfill your needs, at least, you know what I mean? So then, from there, if it's better, huh, why not?


102
00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:41.439
Connor Williams: But, you know.


103
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:56.489
Zoom user: step-by-step, I think everything is step-by-step, you know? Before I had my YouTube channel, I had this mentality. I was like, oh, I will film something today that I would watch, or I think is funny, or I don't know, my friend says it's funny, and it will just be a banger. No, it's not. You know?


104
00:12:56.940 --> 00:13:00.449
Connor Williams: Well, look, I mean… To give you a bit of guidance, then.


105
00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:15.190
Connor Williams: when it comes to, you know, what I help people to do, so my roadmap is always, we get placed in about 90 days, so 3 months, you're actually in your first offer, you know, making money, and the first 3 months, we're trying to get our skill level as high as possible.


106
00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:27.239
Connor Williams: does depend on, obviously, securing the right offer, but when I see the top percentile, the people I work with, what they have been able to do is to hit 8 to 12, 8 to 10K within 6 months, but…


107
00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:40.450
Connor Williams: what I don't ever do is, like, I don't say that's expected for everyone. You know, again, that is the top percentile of the people that I've taught. The average is, in 6 months, probably more 5K to 7K.


108
00:13:41.280 --> 00:14:00.279
Connor Williams: is a mark that people reach, and probably on the lower end, if people are really strapped for time, maybe 3 to 4K. So, really, that's where we sit. So, if you knew that that was the breakdown of people that I've taught, again, like, everyone who comes here is hardworking, where do you think we could sit by the end of the six months?


109
00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:08.260
Zoom user: by another 6 months, I would say in the top tier, but I, you know… I mean, it's not,


110
00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:29.790
Zoom user: I'm not trying to be cocky, you know, but I know myself when I want something, so then, you know, I just know myself, you know. Even in ships, I was the same. I went through the ranks very fast, because I'm… I was dedicating myself, you know, and this is something… and imagine that that was for a corporation, like, you know, this is for myself, so then, you know, I can give it even more. It's just…


111
00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:40.230
Zoom user: The thing is, you know, you never really know where to start and where to go. I mean, people who think that they know, they can do, you have all the information on the internet, blah blah blah, that's…


112
00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:46.029
Zoom user: You need somebody to just… Put you on the right path to give you a bit of, you know.


113
00:14:46.400 --> 00:15:03.269
Connor Williams: Yeah, well, the dropshipping business I had, I tried to do by myself. The trade-in, I tried to do by myself. Those things, I both lost about 30 grand between them. But, you know, the funny thing is, is the marketing agency was the first thing that worked for me. And, you know, I got to 10K in about 3 months' time.


114
00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:06.269
Connor Williams: But I actually joined a course to help me.


115
00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:11.960
Connor Williams: to run that marketing agency. And do you know what the funny thing is? That was the course that I became a high-ticket closer in.


116
00:15:12.390 --> 00:15:12.910
Zoom user: So…


117
00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:27.049
Connor Williams: So that's why I got into this space before high-ticket closing was even a thing. No one was like me telling you about this opportunity. It's just someone who was selling an expensive digital product needed help selling it, and we mutually, you know, thought it would work both ways.


118
00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:45.129
Connor Williams: And that was obviously, like, 6 years ago now, but… yeah, the only thing that worked for me is when I had that kind of proper guidance. But, you know, what I've always found is that, as a mentor, you know, I am always 100% committed to giving everyone what they need to succeed. You know, whether that is more mindset side, whether it is more accountability, whether it's more skill-based.


119
00:15:45.130 --> 00:15:48.449
Connor Williams: But, it is… it is a 50-50 partnership.


120
00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:59.910
Connor Williams: Yeah. I can give everything, but that doesn't mean I can get someone there. You know, the other side has got to come from you, so I guess, you know, if we put, you know, you seem like an ambitious guy, so let's say $8K a month.


121
00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:04.489
Connor Williams: Let's say $8K a month by the end of the 6 months, if we're really gonna push.


122
00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.660
Connor Williams: If you had a path that you knew could get you there.


123
00:16:07.970 --> 00:16:15.969
Connor Williams: How serious do you think you are about it, though, right now? You know, maybe give me a number, like, out of 10, where do you think you are? If 10 was the most and 1 was the least?


124
00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:32.059
Zoom user: I'm gonna say 10, because I'm also human, and the thing is, maybe, I don't know, something in my life could, like, I don't know, no, I'm not saying, long-term, but maybe I will have one or two days, you know, a bit slower, or whatever, but I would say a 9, 9 and a half, maybe.


125
00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:39.230
Connor Williams: Nine and a half, yeah. Well, I mean, when we say 10 out of 10, you know, most of the people I teach are working a day job.


126
00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:57.740
Connor Williams: I don't say to them, right, you need to quit your day job and focus on this full-time, you know, it's something you can actually do part-time, around the day job, but I've always felt like a commitment level to achieve big things, it does need to be a 10. You know, when I got to 10K a month after 5 years of trying, and 3 business models.


127
00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:01.140
Connor Williams: it wasn't easy if we picked myself back off the floor again. I didn't…


128
00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:01.510
Zoom user: Yeah.


129
00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:13.669
Connor Williams: quit my jobs and focus… you know, I had a relationship to work around it, I had jobs, I had other bills, I had priorities that I needed to obviously do, but that didn't stop me from being 10 out of 10 committed to reaching that point.


130
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:25.399
Connor Williams: So, you know, would you be a 10 if you weren't expected to, obviously, if something came up, you don't drop everything, but are you going to be able to give that kind of 100% to make sure you do hit it?


131
00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:27.429
Zoom user: Oh, yeah, of course, yeah, yeah.


132
00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:32.500
Connor Williams: Cool, and then I guess the other thing is, you know, the practicality I've seen


133
00:17:32.610 --> 00:17:37.490
Connor Williams: really go into someone reaching big, big goals in this space. I call it entrepreneurial urgency.


134
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:56.999
Connor Williams: It's, you know, the speed of action between when someone has an idea and when they actually execute on that idea. I've seen that as the biggest indicator of whether someone's going to be successful or not. You know, when we do work with people, I'd set them, like, weekly targets, we have accountability, we have tracking, so it's like, right, this week we need this done, this done, this done. So, you know, do you find sometimes you're a bit…


135
00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:13.209
Connor Williams: you know, people exist in two camps. They're the action takers who just get stuff done, even though it's probably wrong, or we get the analysis paralysis group, the procrastinators a little bit, who overwhelm themselves with a bit too much information. What side of that coin do you feel like you lean more towards?


136
00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:22.510
Zoom user: I think maybe a bit of both, but not… I'm… I'm…


137
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:29.770
Zoom user: I like to maybe overwhelm myself with information, but in the same time.


138
00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:52.870
Zoom user: I'm not that a big, over-thinker, like, you know, like, I'm not really, you know, this weekend, considering that I had my… I'll give you an example, it's easier, I think. I had my son, you know, he was sick with his tooth coming out, whatever, you know, and then at the same time, I knew that this is for my socials, you know? I knew that


139
00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:57.620
Zoom user: like, how I, we speak in kilometers, can I speak in kilometers?


140
00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:58.749
Connor Williams: Yeah, yeah, heh, hey, I know.


141
00:18:58.750 --> 00:19:07.139
Zoom user: Okay, so then I did around 1,000 kilometers while I was also with my son, dealing whatever in the hospital, for just…


142
00:19:07.390 --> 00:19:31.350
Zoom user: a 14-minute video that actually is my most viral video now. It has 10 hours since I launched it, and it's, like, 2Ks of watching time, whatever, you know? So then, I was just like, yeah, yeah, this will… this will do it. So then, I just, you know, went to my car, boom, straight, came back, see him again, went back, you know, I mean, the level of dedication is there, you know, I don't have a problem with that, you know, it's just like…


143
00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:39.459
Zoom user: I mean, I'm that kind of person that will do whatever, you know, I'm like, okay. And it's also, like, in some way.


144
00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:50.889
Zoom user: I'm starting making money on YouTube, but it's not a lot, you know, so then I still have my money on the side, that's fine. I can live with that for at least one year, let's say.


145
00:19:51.090 --> 00:20:01.760
Zoom user: But the thing is, I'm also in that kind of stage of my life, you know, when I tried so many things. I tried with sailing. Sailing was alright, with money. I mean, career-wise.


146
00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:16.959
Zoom user: was good, you know what I mean? Good. Depends what you want with your life. I don't want to have that life, you know, I think you're a bit limited. So then, I'm a bit on that step where, you know, when I want to start and don't stop, you know, this is the step where I'm at at the moment, you know?


147
00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:23.650
Connor Williams: Yeah, 100%. Well, you know, what I've seen in this program, again, like, the timeline and the structure that we have.


148
00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:30.540
Connor Williams: it's in place, and we literally have, you know, by this week, you should be here, this week, and I've seen the people who do the best.


149
00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:37.699
Connor Williams: it's messy action over perfect, you know, perfect strategy. Because, let's say that I set you a task on a Monday.


150
00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:47.570
Connor Williams: what a lot of people do is they stress about it on a Monday, they overthink about it on a Tuesday, they half do it on a Wednesday, change their mind on a Thursday, and finally get something done on a Friday.


151
00:20:47.570 --> 00:21:04.389
Connor Williams: we meet, I tell them it's wrong, and then we change it, and then we get through it, and then it's done by about a Monday. And then you get the other type of people, who are telling them to do something on a Monday, they do it straight away, they do it wrong, but I tell them why they've done it wrong, what they need to do to fix it, they fix it by Tuesday, and then they're on to the next thing.


152
00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:15.310
Connor Williams: So, it is that messy action over that perfect strategy that gets you through. It is not avoiding mistakes, it's inviting them, because when you make a mistake, you learn how to do better.


153
00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:23.570
Connor Williams: When you actually take that step forward, and, you know, you have that entrepreneurial urgency, you get done in a week what most people get done in a month.


154
00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:41.380
Connor Williams: And that is how we get people in roles in 90 days. We get them to 8K by 6 months. So, you know, as a mentor, I'm always going to tell you the things you need to hear, not what you want to hear. I'm always going to push you to do the things that are going to propel you forward, and actually get you to a successful point. So, I mean, is that something you're comfortable working with someone on?


155
00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:51.590
Zoom user: Yeah, probably, in this category that you said, probably, I would be the guy that, if you could tell me something now, I would do it straight away after we close this call, then I will send it to you, then if it's wrong, I will do it again, you know?


156
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:54.729
Connor Williams: Exactly, but then at least we know what's wrong, and how to fix it, and then…


157
00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:56.460
Zoom user: Yeah, exactly, yeah, yeah, yeah.


158
00:21:56.460 --> 00:21:57.499
Connor Williams: 10 times faster.


159
00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:05.019
Zoom user: you know, my patience is a bit to the sky, you know, I'm not like… I'm not gonna wait for something just to drop on my head, you know, I'm just gonna go do it, you know, like, it's fine.


160
00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:21.190
Connor Williams: Good. Well, mate, look, if that's the case, then, again, it's what we do here. I think you're gonna get on very, very well. You've got some experience in selling, we obviously need to tailor that to selling in this space. Obviously, getting you into this space as well, finding a role, all of that good stuff.


161
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:37.060
Connor Williams: I have no problem, and absolutely no doubt that we're going to be able to help you get to that point. But, you know, the final thing I just want to check is, obviously, you're in a position to make something like this work, so what that comes down to, as everything in life, is kind of the time, effort, and finances. So, time-wise.


162
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:40.730
Connor Williams: I ask for a minimum of 15 hours a week.


163
00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:46.019
Connor Williams: And that's obviously flexible, around schedules. Is that something we can put into this right now?


164
00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:47.809
Zoom user: I can probably do more than that.


165
00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:51.510
Connor Williams: I mean, that's the minimum. If you do more, you'll get further quicker, so…


166
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:52.100
Zoom user: Yeah.


167
00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:53.819
Connor Williams: As long as we can do that minimum.


168
00:22:53.880 --> 00:23:08.970
Connor Williams: That's absolutely fine. Effort-wise, I don't really doubt, to be honest with you. We are 10 out of 10 committed to making it work, so I have no doubts on the effort side. Lastly, financially, obviously, to get the skills, training, whatever we need to get into a position of next 6 months, 8K, all that stuff.


169
00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:20.399
Connor Williams: It's gonna depend on what you need, which is what we'll break down in a second, but it will range anywhere between 2K to $5K in total. So, if you saw the path that you were 100% confident it would work.


170
00:23:20.550 --> 00:23:26.440
Connor Williams: Is that amount something you can do, and you're willing to put into a journey like this, if it could help you reach, you know, 8K in the next 6 months?


171
00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:27.660
Zoom user: Yeah.


172
00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:45.569
Connor Williams: Well, look, I don't think there's anything else from my side that I need to ask, mate, so I appreciate you going through that, but yeah, I now want to show you what this is, how it works, go through all your questions as well, so I'm going to share my screen, and I'm going to take you through what the Academy looks like. So let me know when you can see my screen, bud, and then we can go through.


173
00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:49.759
Zoom user: Oh, yeah, I can see it.


174
00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:52.579
Connor Williams: Yeah, perfect. Have you been onto this platform before, school.com?


175
00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:54.050
Zoom user: No.


176
00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:56.060
Connor Williams: No, so it's basically…


177
00:23:56.100 --> 00:24:02.009
Connor Williams: a place where coaches like me can put, like, a course, a community, or coaching, but…


178
00:24:02.010 --> 00:24:22.009
Connor Williams: what really this is about is it, like I said, it's about turning you into the most successful high-ticket closer that I can do. And, you know, if you look at the people that we've helped, they come from a lot of different backgrounds, they've all reached different points, I mean, we need to update this massively, but people like Jay, who was a barbershop owner, Hannah, office worker in the 9-to-5, Steve used to own a takeaway restaurant.


179
00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:27.600
Connor Williams: We've got a lot of the guys who used to be in sales who do very good, but, you know, we've had a lot of people in here.


180
00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:31.449
Connor Williams: Not all of them have loads of sales experience, but what all of them have…


181
00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:44.660
Connor Williams: like I said, it's that commitment, it's that goal that they want to reach. If I can help a 48-year-old housewife who hasn't worked in 20 years, and she's now doing about 8, 9K a month, I know for a fact we're going to help you to do it, but…


182
00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:52.190
Connor Williams: what this really is, like I said, it is mentorship. So, how I like to run that is two things.


183
00:24:52.190 --> 00:25:11.619
Connor Williams: I like to give you clarity, and I like to give you accountability. So when I say clarity, like I said, there is literally a step-by-step list of things you need to do from the moment you join, to setting yourself up, learning the right skills, and then actually landing an offer, making money. And throughout this entire process, there's one-on-one calls that you book with me.


184
00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:26.760
Connor Williams: So, let's say, for example, you've got your first high-ticket offer you're gonna sell for. Well, before you're even taking live calls, we're gonna jump on a call together, break down the scripts, make sure you're prepared. When you are taking calls, we're gonna go through reviews together, make sure you're improving your sales.


185
00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:37.099
Connor Williams: So it is completely one-on-one, it's complete guidance, but the main thing is accountability. Like I said, I want to get you in a role in 90 days, which is about 12 weeks. So every week to get there.


186
00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:54.509
Connor Williams: we go through this together. So, we build a plan of action, you know, what coaching we're gonna do, how many hours we're gonna put in, we're gonna set tangible targets that we're gonna hit each week, but I want you to review this at the end of every week, and tell me, right, how far away from targets was I? Did I exceed them? Did I miss them?


187
00:25:54.510 --> 00:26:09.530
Connor Williams: How was my mindset? How much did I learn this week? How many hours did I actually put in? So we can compare, like, what's happening at the beginning of the week when we say we're going to do things, and what actually happens. So, if you are exceeding every week, we know we need to set more ambitious targets. If you're not.


188
00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:17.500
Connor Williams: we know we need to have some tough talks to get you back on. But that is the level of accountability that we offer. But in terms of the process, like I said.


189
00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:24.800
Connor Williams: We're gonna get you in a role in 90 days, we're gonna get you into, you know, a very successful position by, 6 months, but…


190
00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:41.020
Connor Williams: In the first 3 months, we're gonna go through 3 stages. So we're gonna set you up, we're gonna learn the sales at a high level, then we're gonna finally secure a position as a high-ticket closer. So the reason we start in setup is… it's actually the biggest reason people don't get placed in this industry.


191
00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:44.569
Connor Williams: You know, if you can't position yourself as an actual professional.


192
00:26:44.630 --> 00:27:03.820
Connor Williams: that people want on their team, as the face of their business, you know, selling to their clients, then you're never gonna make it in this space. So that's why we go through branding, that's why we go through even writing a CV, setting yourself up, using the tools in this industry. Even paying yourself as an entrepreneur, we're gonna cover. So you're fully set up as a professional remote sales rep.


193
00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:04.810
Connor Williams: Then?


194
00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:21.940
Connor Williams: When we get into the next stage, which is sales, this should take about 6 weeks, we learn at a very high level what I like to call New Age sales. So, essentially, it's just the opposite of old school. It's how I like to teach sales. I don't want you to be pushy, I don't want you to not listen to people, because


195
00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:33.079
Connor Williams: When people have their life savings, and they're about to, you know, commit to a process that's gonna change their entire life, you're gonna help someone to get in shape, or earn more money, leave their job, or fix their marriage.


196
00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:35.649
Connor Williams: They need to speak to someone that they trust.


197
00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:50.749
Connor Williams: So that's why we go through these skills, that's why we understand the psychology behind sales. And then, when it comes to you being a high-ticket closer, really, it comes to you doing two things. How do you run sales calls, and how do you handle objections?


198
00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:56.920
Connor Williams: So, we have this framework that I built from, you know, over 10,000 hours in high ticket sales.


199
00:27:57.070 --> 00:28:05.359
Connor Williams: I've personally coded millions with this, so it's a step-by-step on how to run a call, and how I like to teach you is, I like to teach you the theory of each part.


200
00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:21.439
Connor Williams: I like to show you me doing it in some live calls, there's, like, 25-mile calls you can watch, and then we write parts out together, until you feel comfortable writing an entire framework for any offer, then we obviously go through objection handling, but the thing for me, it's not about theory, it's about practice. Do you do any sports yourself?


201
00:28:22.450 --> 00:28:29.310
Zoom user: At the moment, I just quit. I was going to the gym, but I just quit because I have my shoulder, my shoulder is destroyed, and my back as well, so then I'm…


202
00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:30.359
Connor Williams: Yes, thank you.


203
00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:37.960
Zoom user: now, 3PM, I need to… I'm… I'm doing some rehab. I started last week, so after that, I hope I will be able to again, yeah.


204
00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:41.169
Connor Williams: Yeah, well, definitely rest up, mate. My shoulders are absolutely torn.


205
00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:58.879
Connor Williams: But, you know, boxing was always my sport, so yeah, I didn't have a couple of fights last year, but it wasn't as if I, like, I watched a YouTube video of Mike Tyson, then stepped into the ring. You know, I had to learn the skill first, and then I had to practice them in a safe environment, you know, do a little bit of light sparring, then I'd pick up the pace, and then…


206
00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:12.480
Connor Williams: I would do it in an environment close to the real thing before I was ready for the real thing, and that's what we do here. You're going to be closing deals with us, practicing, before you're in the actual industry doing it, so you can feel 100% confident in your ability


207
00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:19.759
Connor Williams: Before you go out there. But, the final thing, the last month, is about actually landing a high ticket offer. Now, what I will say.


208
00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:32.830
Connor Williams: is that we have a network of offers that you can apply straight into. We literally have recruiters who work in this network as well, so we give you exclusive access to a lot of offers within this. But…


209
00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:50.570
Connor Williams: just because I can give you an offer doesn't mean I can give you a role. You know, they need to speak to you, they need to hear you, they need to believe that you're the right person, so that's why we go through all of these skills properly. So you know how to find these people, how to reach out to them, how to get in front of them. Because also, I want you to be self-sufficient.


210
00:29:50.610 --> 00:30:07.149
Connor Williams: I want you to have the ability to get a role no matter what. So, we'll go through what a good offer looks like, what a bad one looks like, how to get in front of them, what to say in these interviews, because what they're not is 9-to-5 jobs. You can't get a role in an entrepreneurial space with the same principles as an employed space, so…


211
00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:20.990
Connor Williams: we go through all these things properly, which is why we literally guarantee in writing that someone's going to be able to land the role. And, you know, we've touched wood. We've never had to give anyone their money back, because every single person who's followed this has landed a role. So, that really is…


212
00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:35.590
Connor Williams: the step-by-step, but on top of that, you know, what we do is a lot of community in here as well. So, I'm really big on this community. I mean, we're doing the Three Peaks as a community this year. We've done Scaffold Pike, I don't know if you saw with Connor, he joined us.


213
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:51.579
Connor Williams: We've done one of the mountain climbs, last month. We do live events, live training events, so we get together as a community. We've got group calls as well, so 4 times a week, we do live, group calls and group sessions. So you have lifetime access to the group calls, to the network, to all that stuff.


214
00:30:51.580 --> 00:31:01.949
Connor Williams: So really, everything in here is going to ensure that you hit a successful point as a closer. And that is the Academy, man. So yeah, we'd love to go through questions, thoughts, and anything else you want to dive into.


215
00:31:03.810 --> 00:31:09.159
Zoom user: Yeah, that sounds good, actually. I've seen that, yeah, you know, you never really…


216
00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:17.719
Zoom user: When you wanna join something like that from a person that actually did it, you know, with… for, let's say, with dropshipping.


217
00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:27.199
Zoom user: I had a… it was… after I tried myself, I had… it was not an academy, it was a course, maybe, something like that, you know, it's a… it was the…


218
00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:28.909
Zoom user: you know…


219
00:31:29.110 --> 00:31:42.260
Zoom user: the most basic course, the same like the courses that they are selling for social media, let's say, where… wherever they say, it's just, you need to be motivated, ambitious, post, that's it, you know, this is not helpful, you know, I mean, you know, it's just…


220
00:31:44.020 --> 00:31:50.319
Zoom user: And also from Conor, this is not like that, so, you know, that's why I was actually interested, you know, like…


221
00:31:50.580 --> 00:32:05.890
Connor Williams: Well, I think the main thing is, you know, if you did go through this process, obviously we have a goal of hitting, like, 8K by the end of the 6 months. And you said you want to be, you know, one of the best guys here, so… you've seen the process now. Do you actually believe that in 6 months you could reach that point?


222
00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:07.299
Zoom user: I think so, yeah.


223
00:32:07.850 --> 00:32:11.069
Connor Williams: Think so? Any… any uncertainty there?


224
00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:16.129
Zoom user: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Just, you know, probably the language barrier, yeah.


225
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:20.360
Connor Williams: Yeah, all good, man. Well, yeah, I guess the final question is, are we ready to do this, then?


226
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.820
Zoom user: Yeah.


227
00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:31.910
Connor Williams: Cool, well, look, let's go through what that looks like, the next steps, investment, obviously important questions. So, for the full program, that's all the one-on-one with me, the guarantee, that is the 5K.


228
00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:53.130
Connor Williams: So, that gives you everything that we just bent through. But, I mean, the main thing for me, like I said, is that entrepreneurial urgency. I just want to work with people who want to get stuck in as soon as possible, hit their goals, because they're a lot easier for me to work with as well. So, if we do want to get started straight away, I'll obviously incentivize that. So, rather than 5K, I'd give you £1400 off.


229
00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:55.160
Connor Williams: And it would only be $3,600.


230
00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:57.350
Zoom user: Okay, okay.


231
00:32:57.670 --> 00:32:58.620
Connor Williams: Does that work?


232
00:32:58.620 --> 00:32:59.390
Zoom user: Yeah.


233
00:32:59.690 --> 00:33:14.210
Connor Williams: Cool. Well, look, it's nice and straightforward, mate. So, what we do is we take the payment, we get you your login details, and we get you into the platform, and I'll introduce you into the group. And then, I like to do an onboarding call the day after. And in that onboarding call, what we basically go through


234
00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:26.580
Connor Williams: is what we think we're gonna potentially struggle with, what we're going to do well with. We're gonna set an actual solid goal to hit in the next 6 months, and we're gonna build a roadmap from day one of exactly what we need to do to get there.


235
00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:33.900
Connor Williams: So, all I need to know, is, yeah, figure out what email address you want to get all your account details set up under. Is it the same one we booked the call-in with?


236
00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:35.399
Zoom user: Same one, yeah. Same one.


237
00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:52.109
Connor Williams: Okay, wonderful. So, what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna send you over the payment link, and while you're taking care of that, I'm gonna get you logged in and an account set up, and then, do you know when you're gonna be free tomorrow to do an onboarding call?


238
00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:56.579
Zoom user: I will know in…


239
00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:02.000
Zoom user: 1 hour or two hours, because I need to know the schedule for the rehab tomorrow.


240
00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.310
Connor Williams: Okay. Well, I mean, you've got direct access to me anyway, so, yeah.


241
00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:06.630
Zoom user: Yeah.


242
00:34:06.670 --> 00:34:08.380
Connor Williams: Book that in as soon as you know, but…


243
00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:12.789
Zoom user: I mean, the rehab is just one hour and a half, that's not a problem, but I don't know exactly what schedule it will be.


244
00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:28.920
Connor Williams: Yeah. Well, I've got some times tomorrow, so if I give you my times that I'm free, we can look at getting that in, but let's get you logged in now anyway. So I've just emailed you over the, the payment link. When you open that, make sure it says 3.6K, not 5K, and the discount is.


245
00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:29.569
Zoom user: I can come off.


246
00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:33.340
Connor Williams: Okay. I'm just gonna get your account details set up now as well.


247
00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.159
Connor Williams: So…


248
00:34:46.739 --> 00:34:50.379
Connor Williams: Yeah, question is, Connor's been in about 5 weeks now, are you gonna catch him up?


249
00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:51.780
Zoom user: I think so, yeah.


250
00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:52.475
Connor Williams: Haha!


251
00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:57.909
Connor Williams: I think he said he's already done about £1,700 pound this week.


252
00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:02.049
Zoom user: I've seen his stories, yeah.


253
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:04.880
Connor Williams: Right… there we go.


254
00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:14.719
Zoom user: actually, me and Connor were the only ones from the company who actually were like, okay, we're just gonna leave, do something better, you know, like…


255
00:35:14.720 --> 00:35:17.060
Connor Williams: Yeah, did you hear about what they tried to do to him?


256
00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:17.820
Zoom user: No.


257
00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:24.189
Connor Williams: Like, they tried to, get him to take all his social media off, like, all his hard 75.


258
00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:25.010
Zoom user: Yeah?


259
00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:28.110
Connor Williams: Yeah, something ridiculous like that, I couldn't believe it.


260
00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:30.889
Zoom user: But… I just don't…


261
00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:36.999
Zoom user: I need to calculate this in euros, just a moment, so I can do by transfer.


262
00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:42.789
Zoom user: I didn't know they tried to do that to him.


263
00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:51.440
Connor Williams: Yeah, yeah, they tried to get him to take all his social media down, then they said he couldn't work his notice, period, and I think he just ended up, yeah, alright, whatever, I'll quit.


264
00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:53.540
Connor Williams: Yeah, ridiculous.


265
00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:54.330
Zoom user: Interesting.


266
00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:19.699
Connor Williams: I think I got fired about 4 times from my day jobs because they found out I was having a business on the side, so…


267
00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:22.859
Connor Williams: Yeah, I told him, I've been used to that side.


268
00:36:24.610 --> 00:36:27.360
Zoom user: They never found out about mine, but…


269
00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:31.120
Zoom user: I was not really filming on the ship, to be honest.


270
00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.200
Connor Williams: Yeah.


271
00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:41.770
Connor Williams: Alright, so your account details… Oh.


272
00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:46.260
Connor Williams: So that should get sent to you as soon as that payment comes through.


273
00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:48.150
Zoom user: Yeah, just a moment…


274
00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:53.470
Connor Williams: And let me look at my diary for tomorrow as well, when I'm free.


275
00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:03.670
Zoom user: Okay…


276
00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:28.910
Zoom user: Okay, just a moment, I need to… I'm just transferring my money, because I have my money in Euros, so…


277
00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:30.160
Connor Williams: Oh, yeah, no worries, ma'am.


278
00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:50.410
Zoom user: Okay…


279
00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:16.689
Zoom user: Okay, that should be done.


280
00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:18.499
Connor Williams: Yes, let's have a look.


281
00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:25.439
Connor Williams: Officially, welcome to the team, man.


282
00:38:25.650 --> 00:38:26.500
Zoom user: Thank you.


283
00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:28.330
Connor Williams: Cool, so yeah, look, you've got…


284
00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:29.210
Zoom user: Thanks for having me.


285
00:38:29.210 --> 00:38:43.009
Connor Williams: Mate, like I said, we're gonna absolutely smash this journey. So, you've got an email that will be sent out, and it's like your membership agreement. As soon as you sign that, then another email goes out and gives you your login details for the platform. Tomorrow…


286
00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:48.880
Connor Williams: I've got, spaces at 10 o'clock, 4 o'clock, and 6 o'clock.


287
00:38:49.570 --> 00:39:01.079
Zoom user: Right, so I think probably the best time is gonna be maybe 4 or 6 o'clock. I mean, either they were gonna put me to the rehab by 30, either they're gonna put me, like, 3 o'clock, like today, so then…


288
00:39:02.010 --> 00:39:07.810
Connor Williams: So, should I… should I pencil in 6 o'clock, and then if we need to change it to 4, we can do?


289
00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:09.250
Zoom user: Yeah, I think so, yeah.


290
00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:13.969
Connor Williams: Yeah, just in case, sorry, my diary is very fast-moving sometimes, so if I just drop it out…


291
00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:50.030
Connor Williams: When you're… yeah, when we get you in, I'm just gonna share my screen again, I'll take you through what you need to do between now and then, but you should have a…


292
00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:53.819
Connor Williams: Yeah, you should have an invite for tomorrow at 6 as well.


293
00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:59.609
Zoom user: Cross program invite you to join the community, okay.


294
00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:02.439
Zoom user: Oh, so it's another one.


295
00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:11.499
Connor Williams: Yeah, so you get another email, and then it'll ask you to set up in school, it'll ask you for, like, a profile picture and a bio. You don't have to do too much about that now, we just want to get you in.


296
00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:12.930
Zoom user: Yeah.


297
00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:20.440
Connor Williams: Okay, I got the email for the meeting as well, for tomorrow, yeah. Yeah, well, like I said, if you need to move it, though, just let me know.


298
00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:21.060
Zoom user: Yeah.


299
00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:31.680
Zoom user: Okay… Membership…


300
00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:40.339
Zoom user: Join, the, join the community, okay.


301
00:40:40.590 --> 00:40:42.030
Zoom user: school.com.


302
00:40:56.590 --> 00:41:01.059
Zoom user: Just a question. Do we pay taxes for this?


303
00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:04.609
Connor Williams: Depends on where you're based. So…


304
00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:16.929
Connor Williams: wherever you're going… so, when we go through the setup, I'm gonna go through the options of either doing self-employed or business. So, if you do it for a business, it's a lot less tax that you'll have to pay.


305
00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:30.240
Connor Williams: Some people have, like, set up a digital nomad visa, and then they travel through this, and then they pay themselves there, so… yeah. When we get to the point of actually starting to close, let's look at what best way we can do this, but…


306
00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:37.419
Connor Williams: you could either set up a business in the UK and then pay yourself, there's a lot of different ways we can do this.


307
00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:39.000
Zoom user: Okay.


308
00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:41.160
Zoom user: I was just curious.


309
00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:49.529
Connor Williams: Yeah, I'm trying to reset up mine, because I have to pay 20% VAT, no matter what. Like, 20% of my money just goes straight out of the window.


310
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:51.359
Zoom user: Oh, that's insane.


311
00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:52.350
Connor Williams: Yeah.


312
00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:56.670
Connor Williams: Yeah, I've got a friend in Dubai where they pay, like, 5% or something stupid like that.


313
00:41:56.970 --> 00:41:57.650
Zoom user: Yeah.


314
00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:59.440
Zoom user: Yeah.


315
00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:01.889
Zoom user: That's what I was thinking about, yeah.


316
00:42:51.490 --> 00:42:56.009
Connor Williams: Let me know when you're done your bio, and I'll share my screen again, and I'll just take you through the onboarding stuff.


317
00:42:56.530 --> 00:42:58.160
Zoom user: What should I write on the bio?


318
00:42:58.390 --> 00:42:59.180
Zoom user: I mean…


319
00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:09.459
Connor Williams: So, I mean, you can literally just put high ticket closure if you want, that doesn't matter too much. Yeah, I think you just gotta put a little bit, and then, yeah, you can always change it at a later date.


320
00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:28.709
Zoom user: I just wrote, high ticket, almost closer.


321
00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:59.790
Connor Williams: There we go. So… So, here we go.


322
00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:05.300
Connor Williams: So before our call tomorrow, what you need to do is you need to go into the classroom.


323
00:44:05.520 --> 00:44:06.060
Zoom user: Okay.


324
00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:18.299
Connor Williams: into the setup, and then just make your way through the Start Here module. The most important… obviously, I detail this in the video, in case you forget, but the most important thing is to get this workspace set up. Have you used Notion before?


325
00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:19.599
Zoom user: No.


326
00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:38.290
Connor Williams: Okay, this is what… Notion is the builder of this, but basically you get onto this, you copy it over, you make your own, and then you share it with me. And then all I need you to do before our call tomorrow is… is this. So, to fill in this onboarding form. What I want to do is I want to build this in as a routine.
