1
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.240
IPhone: Hello, Connor?


2
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:08.950
Connor Williams: There we go.


3
00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.139
IPhone: Oh, man, how are you?


4
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.460
Connor Williams: Yeah, I'm all good, man, I'm all good. How about yourself?


5
00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.029
IPhone: Yeah, all good, yeah. I've just been, I've took the day off work to watch a few video, just to get ready for this, like…


6
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:20.129
Connor Williams: Yeah. Yeah.


7
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:39.749
Connor Williams: Nice. Well, yeah, Connor's told me a little bit about yourself, about the conversation you've had. So, I feel like I got a little bit of an understanding, especially with the application you filled in, but obviously it would be great to learn a bit more. You know, I'd love to understand a bit more about where you're coming into this space, where you actually want to get to, how much you understand already, and then the most important thing


8
00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:49.980
Connor Williams: is that, you know, I feel like I can actually build you a path to get there. So, you know, as Connor probably explained, what this is, it is coaching, it is mentorship. So, yes, there's a course, yes, there's a process.


9
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:59.899
Connor Williams: But I've always found the way I can get people into, you know, the dream position of 10K months, or 20K months, or, you know, even had some of my guys even hit 30, but…


10
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:12.050
Connor Williams: it was only through really close mentorship. Me backing them up in their corner, giving them the support, the advice, the guidance that they need. So, yeah, tell me, man, what's kind of brought you into this space and looking into these things?


11
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.130
Connor Williams: Bro…


12
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.329
IPhone: mostly to start with, I've been following Connor.


13
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:26.180
IPhone: is really the only person in my… like, we live in a town called Whitehaven, like a small town, and it's basically just a thing where everyone has the same job.


14
00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.650
Connor Williams: Stop.


15
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.809
IPhone: Colin's probably told you already, and he was…


16
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:42.280
IPhone: what I seen him doing. Like, to be fair, initially, I was just watching him, because he was doing all these cruise ships, so I thought, that's smart, I like that. And he was doing all this stuff, and then, obviously, when I seen his quit his job.


17
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.550
IPhone: I thought, is he mental? Like, he's… he's living the dream life.


18
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:47.250
Connor Williams: Forced.


19
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.809
IPhone: when I look, like, I've been looking into it for a while, but I suppose the turning point for me was the job that I'm in now, like.


20
00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:01.999
IPhone: I've been there, I did a four-year apprenticeship, when I was 19, to be a mechanical fitter, at a place called Sullafield.


21
00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.740
Connor Williams: Yeah.


22
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.259
IPhone: Which is basically what everyone's told to do from school, like, if you don't work at Telefield.


23
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.030
Connor Williams: Yeah.


24
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:26.639
IPhone: Do you know what I mean? And then, so I've been at my time for two years, and I don't… to be fair, I've been pretty successful at that. I mean, I was… I was only working there for a year. I was the assistant team leader, I was, in charge of all the calibrated equipment, all that stuff, and then something came up where something went wrong.


25
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:34.819
IPhone: I was the first person out the door, without any sort of consideration of anything. So, it basically just rang through to me that I am just a number.


26
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:48.810
IPhone: I'm very easily replaceable. So I've moved to a new spot. I do… I do like my job, I do. It's just that it's a case of, we do nothing all day. It's mentally draining. Have you heard… do you know what Sellerfield is?


27
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.299
Connor Williams: I only briefly heard it from him, so, yeah.


28
00:02:52.550 --> 00:03:12.110
IPhone: it's this cold, dingy side. Luckily, I get to work with some amazing people. Yeah. It makes it… makes it bearable, and we have a laugh when we do all this, but… like, I was saying to Connor yesterday, I was like, it is all fun, like, I'm earning £3,000 a month for nothing, but at the end of the day, I'm sat there in the freezing cold, doing nothing. I mean…


29
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.319
IPhone: What was it, Tuesday? I slept for 3 hours in a van.


30
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.319
IPhone: Do you know what I mean? Like… like…


31
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.070
IPhone: But when there is a job on, I love what I do.


32
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:34.699
IPhone: When we're actually doing it, but another thing for me was, like, looking around, seeing everyone else, it's like, this is all well and good, but it's never gonna get any better. Yeah. This is… this is us for life,


33
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.280
IPhone: And then you hear people talk, like, oh, in a few years, Sam, I'm gonna get this, I'm gonna get this, and it's like, yeah, but…


34
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:58.449
IPhone: stuff's gonna get through at you, where it's gonna knock it back, and you'll never end up getting it, because it's just… you know what I mean? Yeah. So, and then seeing Connor, he's quit his job, and I was like, it was really trust this process, so I've been looking into a few things, to be fair. Like, this isn't my first Zoom call, I've been on a few. Yeah.


35
00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:05.889
IPhone: just because of Maya, I was like, a conversation's never harmed anyone. So, I've been jumping on calls, with a few folk.


36
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.270
IPhone: some, like, dropshipping, another one, appoint… appointment setting, so I was talking to Connie yesterday.


37
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:12.049
Connor Williams: Car out, yeah.


38
00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.099
IPhone: about appointment setting and closing.


39
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:22.550
IPhone: And initially, I was just interested in the appointment setting, because I ran into a bloke a few weeks ago.


40
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:30.059
IPhone: And then I seen his Instagram, he's living in… basically living in Dubai now, and I was like, whatever he is doing, I want to know what he's doing.


41
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:38.020
IPhone: He's quitting his job, I wanna know. So, I was running this Zoom call with something called Setus Gold, I don't know if you've heard of it.


42
00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.479
Connor Williams: Rings a bell, they are, you know, not too similar to this.


43
00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:50.329
IPhone: And we were going through it, and I was like, this is something I could do this, but then, at the end of the call, the fellow was just hounding me to pay the money.


44
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.930
Connor Williams: Yeah.


45
00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.729
IPhone: And, like, like I was saying to Connor yesterday, he was trying way too hard.


46
00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:07.409
IPhone: it put me off, massively, because it was a case of, like, I said to him, I said, I'm interested, 100%, and he was like, yeah, and then he interrupted me, he was like, yeah, I'll send you the payment on it. I said, hang fire, I've got a few things to say.


47
00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:21.120
IPhone: So, he was saying that, he's like, oh, we can do a payment plan. I was like, yeah, that's fine. Is there any chance I can get back to you tomorrow? Basically, just because I didn't trust him. Yeah. And that's all it was, really. I did not trust who I was speaking to.


48
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.890
Connor Williams: Yeah.


49
00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.360
IPhone: And it was constantly…


50
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:29.319
IPhone: can you fill this form, or can you do this? And at the end of the day, I said, listen, this isn't for me.


51
00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.790
IPhone: If you're that desperate.


52
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:36.579
IPhone: To actually just get the money off me, instead of the mentorship.


53
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.140
IPhone: it's not something that I want to pursue, so that got enough, as I said, and then I.


54
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.530
Connor Williams: Was he the mentor, or was he just selling on behalf of the mentor?


55
00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.350
IPhone: One of his team, it was one of his teams.


56
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:51.209
IPhone: This is another reason why I feel comfortable talking to you, is because I know you're the mentor.


57
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:52.010
Connor Williams: Yeah.


58
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:58.500
IPhone: which is a big plus. And then, obviously, I was looking back and forward on Connor, and then I was speaking to my last the other day.


59
00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.130
IPhone: And I said, just put a YouTube video on.


60
00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:16.230
IPhone: he said, right, we'll put it on. She's not interested, like, she's just not bothered at all. And I was sat there watching him, and then he was talking about what he was doing about his property, and he's gonna get into his high-ticket sales closing, and all this, and he's quitting his job, he's gonna travel the world.


61
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:26.600
IPhone: And then he got talking about Sellerfield, and he's giving me a goof, like, because he was saying about Sellafield, and I sat there and I thought, he's 100% right, like, and I said, an army in the circle.


62
00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.979
IPhone: And then, so I thought, I wondered if it's worth a message.


63
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:31.520
Connor Williams: Yeah.


64
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.819
IPhone: been going back and forth for a few days, should I message him, should I not?


65
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:50.330
IPhone: And then, it just went… it just got to a point where I was like, do you know what? I'm doing it. I'm just gonna message him, see what happens. So, we went for a coffee yesterday, and he sort of gave me the brief overview of what high-ticket closing is, how he got into it.


66
00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:58.769
IPhone: and stuff like that, so I thought… I mean, one of the main things is that I've seen firsthand from someone that I know


67
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:04.919
IPhone: Instead of just jumping into things… but it's all… honestly, if I'm…


68
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:10.380
IPhone: if I'm honest with you, it's all because I didn't… I don't trust anyone at… It's…


69
00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:29.080
Connor Williams: Yeah, you know, the online space is hard, especially if you have… you know, I come from a very similar area, it's a very small-town mentality. People get trapped in the same cycle, and, like, life till death. It's not like they do it for a few years and they finally realize they need to, you know, everyone I grew up with…


70
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:45.609
Connor Williams: is pretty much in the same job they've been in the last 10, 15 years. Yeah. Living the same life on repeat, and that was something that always terrified me. So, looking online, everything seemed like it was what I wanted to do, where I wanted to be, but yeah, until you taste it for yourself.


71
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:55.830
Connor Williams: it's never gonna feel 100% real. So finding the right people is incredibly important. But also, on top of that, it is finding the right thing. So…


72
00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:02.110
Connor Williams: with, you know, with the few things you've looked at, I mean, what is it about high-ticket closing that stands out amongst the other things?


73
00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:03.860
IPhone: the mentorship.


74
00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:08.400
IPhone: Because I'm not a person, like… I'm very…


75
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:18.250
IPhone: a visual learner, definitely. I mean, he told me to go over there, take that chair out, and put it back. When I got over there, I'd say, what did you want me to do again?


76
00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:32.189
IPhone: But if I see what I'm doing, and I learn it by doing it, I'm 10 times better. I'm just not capable of being told, told only, and I do need to be shown. I don't know if that's a downside.


77
00:08:32.350 --> 00:08:34.530
IPhone: Or a good side.


78
00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:43.429
Connor Williams: Like everything, it has its pros and it has its cons. It usually means that when you do get shown to do something, you retain that information very, very well.


79
00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:55.500
Connor Williams: But, you know, it needs to… it needs to… sometimes it just is a… it's a… point of it just needs to click, right? Yeah. It's that when you've shown something, and you get a bit of experience in it, rather than just looking theory-wise.


80
00:08:55.690 --> 00:09:13.320
Connor Williams: then things click, you know, so it's why a lot of what we do is practical-based as well. You know, people do, like, their role plays with me, with other students, before they're ever closing in an offer, because I can sit here and… not that it is, but I can show… I show you 100,000 sales videos, and you can sit there for 100 hours going through content, but…


81
00:09:13.510 --> 00:09:26.229
Connor Williams: turn that into a live call, and it's gonna be completely different. So, look, this, I mean, it's the way we like to teach, very heavily leaning into the practice side, the experience side. But, you know, I'm curious, like, with the high-ticket sales side.


82
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:33.610
Connor Williams: What is it about closing you think attracts you to it? How do you think you're going to be closing deals, like, high-level sales skills, all that side?


83
00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:42.500
IPhone: Well, one thing I definitely need to work on is, like, I'm a very confident person, day to day, but I've got absolutely no sales, except nothing.


84
00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.200
Connor Williams: I couldn't even tell you the steam of hot dog at the minute.


85
00:09:45.250 --> 00:09:45.780
IPhone: I wouldn't…


86
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:57.919
IPhone: I don't know, but one thing I definitely know that I need to get better at is speaking to people, like, formally and professionally, because, like, I just don't know how to do it. And then when I was speaking to Connor, he was like.


87
00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:06.200
Connor Williams: you're the exact same as me, I'm the same. He said, I'm going through it now, but then, obviously, you mentioned to me about the, the mentorship review, and you do the, like, the…


88
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:18.400
IPhone: the run-throughs of your sales, and then you'll show me how, what, like, sort of take this out, put this in. And hopefully, like, initially, I know people probably get on these calls, think, oh, I want to make loads of money.


89
00:10:18.810 --> 00:10:19.720
Connor Williams: And…


90
00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.400
IPhone: I'm in the same boat, I do.


91
00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:21.960
Connor Williams: Yeah.


92
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:23.610
IPhone: But…


93
00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:42.639
IPhone: like I said to Connor yesterday, it's more about the skill that I'm probably about learning first. I said, I know the money will come later, but I just need to learn how to… how to do it first. And I've been the same, to be fair, with everything in my life. A bit like you, when you… that short video, you wanted me to watch it, initially. Watched it, and you were saying, like, you've been in and out of loads of different jobs, I mean.


94
00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:43.510
Connor Williams: Yeah.


95
00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:47.600
IPhone: I mean, when I left school, I left and I went to be a professional rugby player.


96
00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.520
IPhone: Awesome.


97
00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.659
Connor Williams: What position do you play?


98
00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:50.700
IPhone: Okay.


99
00:10:50.700 --> 00:11:01.530
Connor Williams: Oh, nice, I was a winger back in the day. You stuck on the end. Yeah, well, you know, I was Army, well, high school, then Army, and playing against a lot of Fijians.


100
00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:06.090
Connor Williams: Doesn't matter how far ahead you are, how outside, they will always find you.


101
00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:07.439
IPhone: how big boys I'm like.


102
00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:15.100
Connor Williams: And they don't… they don't… what annoys me is they don't fucking train. They don't go to the gym, they don't do anything, but they're just superhuman.


103
00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:16.230
IPhone: Supergenetics, isn't it


104
00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:30.549
IPhone: So, yeah, but I was only there for, like, 2 weeks, because that's… because I was 16, I couldn't live on my own. I had to go and live with another family, so I got put up with another family, and with, like, 3 people, and after a week, I was like, I don't like this, it's… it's uncomfortable.


105
00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.400
IPhone: So, I rang my mum, I was like, I'm coming home.


106
00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:37.560
Connor Williams: And it was, you're doing what? I said, no, I'm coming home.


107
00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:41.199
IPhone: Then I got along, and then I had… I had the dreaded conversation with my dad. He was like.


108
00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:41.810
Connor Williams: Yeah.


109
00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:43.230
IPhone: Well, what are you gonna do now, then?


110
00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:47.359
IPhone: Don't know, I'm gonna have to get a job. So then I worked at McDonald's.


111
00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:48.740
Connor Williams: Fun.


112
00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:56.109
IPhone: It was awful. One of the worst things. So I worked at McDonald's for about 6 months, and then I got an apprenticeship to do the mechanical engineer.


113
00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:57.570
Connor Williams: So I did…


114
00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:04.410
IPhone: for about 6 months, we did both. I was getting up at 6 o'clock in the morning, and I wasn't getting home till about 11 o'clock at night. Wow. And it was…


115
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.970
IPhone: it didn't go on for long because I was mentally and physically destroyed, like…


116
00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:16.739
IPhone: when I was getting old, my feet were killing, I was like, this can't go on. So, I completely…


117
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:33.070
IPhone: I left McDonald's, I said, I'm not gonna do that, I'm just gonna focus on this. And then I got there, and to be fair, I was genuinely happy throughout here, because none of this… none of this was in my head. I was just, like… I remember I seen a reel, I was going through your Instagram yesterday, and a reel that rang through to me was about the ant in the circle.


118
00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:34.980
Connor Williams: Oh, dear.


119
00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:41.700
IPhone: Yeah, and you were saying, if you put an ant in a circle, he won't get out until he… and once he breaks out, his vision opens up, and for about…


120
00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:43.260
Connor Williams: You can't be trapped again.


121
00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:45.110
IPhone: Yeah, that's what I mean. So, like…


122
00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:51.859
IPhone: for about a year's time, I was doing what I was doing, I was like, oh, I'm on three grand a month, this is ideal at least, I was still living at home.


123
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:56.059
IPhone: And I was doing all this, and I didn't even think, because I was just… I was just comfortable where I was at.


124
00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:56.570
Connor Williams: Okay.


125
00:12:56.570 --> 00:13:03.290
IPhone: Very random month, I'm doing nothing, this is ideal. And then it was only really when it was very evident that I was just a number.


126
00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:07.999
IPhone: no matter how much effort you put in, it'll just get out anyway. Yeah.


127
00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:19.750
Connor Williams: Yeah, well, you know, it's… yeah, it's unfortunately what most people do. It is the normal. Things like this are seen as weird, strange, because they aren't the normal things.


128
00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:30.180
Connor Williams: But, you know, if you want a life that's better than most people, you have to do the things that most people aren't willing to do, which is put the hard work in. It's, you know, not…


129
00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:43.799
Connor Williams: have these instant gratification loops where everything you do is more about coping with your life than improving it. I think that was a frame where I started to see things very different in my life, is if I look at my actions and what I actually do.


130
00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:48.619
Connor Williams: Is it more about coping, or is it more about changing?


131
00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:58.630
Connor Williams: Yeah. And I was stuck on the weekend cycle, you know, stuck on the caffeine cycle, stuck on all of these things where I would do them to excess just to cope with my situation.


132
00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:05.579
Connor Williams: But when I started to look at it like that and do the things that really sucked now, but benefited me in the long run.


133
00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:11.490
Connor Williams: And I put more emphasis into changing rather than coping, that's when things really started to happen.


134
00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:22.079
IPhone: Yeah, a bit out of your comfort zone, yeah? And that's sort of where I want to be. Like, I know this… this is… this is gonna be really uncomfortable for me. I know it is, but…


135
00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:28.960
IPhone: I'm not bothered. It is what it is. If it teaches me something in the end, like, it's worth it. Do you know what I mean?


136
00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:33.689
Connor Williams: Yeah, but getting to a process, or getting through a process like this.


137
00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:38.190
Connor Williams: it always comes down to two things, whether you're gonna do it or not. It is…


138
00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:55.250
Connor Williams: do you know what you're trying to do, and do you have the right reason for doing it? It's what you want, and it's why you're doing it. So, I'd like to look at the what we want side of things, because what we need to make sure is that this aligns. There's no point trying to strive for something. There we go.


139
00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:58.069
IPhone: Make profits, just drop me.


140
00:14:58.370 --> 00:15:03.610
Connor Williams: Yeah, so that's… there's no point trying to strive for something if it isn't going to give you what you actually want.


141
00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:04.800
IPhone: Yeah. So…


142
00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:19.919
Connor Williams: Have you got any goals that you are hoping to work towards in this space? And what I appreciate is you said that, look, I'm not expecting 10K a month in 2 months, I want to develop the skills, because then the money will come. But, you know, what do we actually want out of this?


143
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:33.710
IPhone: I want to at least double my salary, as a stepping stone. Like, I don't want to try and run before I can walk, as I've told you, basically. Double my salary, and then eventually, if it's going well, and it's something I'm good at.


144
00:15:34.410 --> 00:15:41.080
IPhone: Because I'm stepping into the unknown at the minute. If it's something I'm good at, then I am fully prepared to quit my job.


145
00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:47.879
IPhone: Not even… not even a question. Once I'm doing that, I'll walk in there with the biggest smile on my face and say, I ain't coming back.


146
00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:53.709
Connor Williams: Yeah. So, first goal is replacing income, so doing 3K,


147
00:15:54.100 --> 00:16:03.610
Connor Williams: And I mean, look, if you're doing part-time closing and you're earning 3K, you can double your hours when you do it full-time and pretty much be on the 6K overnight. Well, not overnight, but within the month, let's say.


148
00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:09.929
Connor Williams: But, getting to that point, I mean, do you even know what, you know, 3K or 6K would even look like as a high-ticket closer?


149
00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.290
IPhone: I don't, to be honest with you, I don't,


150
00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:22.379
IPhone: I know you're saying part-time, in terms of, like, these businesses, or whatever they're doing, fitness, mental, all that. They'll obviously have full-time closers.


151
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:29.389
IPhone: And then, it was one of your videos where you said, but they need someone part-time, because when they finish their full-time, they need someone to carry on.


152
00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:43.989
Connor Williams: Exactly. You can't have a closer who works from 7 in the morning to 11 o'clock at night, 6 days a week, or 7 days a week. You need an evenings, a weekend to cover, you know, you need someone to kind of do the part-time as well as the full-time. But, you know, if you look at the space.


153
00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:56.589
Connor Williams: The most important numbers you should be focused on as a closer is your close rate. So that's how many calls you have to take to convert an actual sale. So, the typical average in this space should be around 30%.


154
00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:11.539
Connor Williams: lowest, they'll let you off in around 20%, but, you know, I was towards the end of my kind of closing side, I was doing 60-75%. So, some months I would take, you know, 4 calls and close 3 people. So…


155
00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:22.709
Connor Williams: Let's be conservative, though, because I don't like to sell anyone a dream. I want to put the worst-case scenarios in place. So, if you're closing at 20%, that means you've got to take 5 calls in order to make 1 sale.


156
00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:28.269
Connor Williams: Now, high ticket means 5K to 25K in most cases.


157
00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:31.620
Connor Williams: Sometimes as low as 4K in USD.


158
00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:44.889
Connor Williams: Which is about £3,000. So let's say we're on the very low end, and we sell something at 3 grand in pounds. We take 10% commission, which is 300, and we've got to take 5 calls in order to close one person.


159
00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:56.829
Connor Williams: So, if that is a target of 3K first to replace income, that means 10 sales. So what's that? 50 calls. So we've got to take 50 calls over the course of a month.


160
00:17:57.130 --> 00:18:03.450
Connor Williams: So, 50 hours worked over a month, on top of, obviously, a day job, is that something we feel like we can do?


161
00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:04.620
IPhone: 100%.


162
00:18:04.890 --> 00:18:11.110
IPhone: It's one of the things that I told Connie yesterday, because I've got so much time at work, where I work.


163
00:18:11.450 --> 00:18:18.740
IPhone: everyone leaves you alone. I said, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go in there, I'm gonna get Pierce to be in there, and I'm gonna do this while I'm there.


164
00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:19.689
Connor Williams: Right, absolutely touched.


165
00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:23.239
IPhone: And he was saying, this is ideal, this…


166
00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:23.620
Connor Williams: Yeah.


167
00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:27.400
IPhone: And I said, I'll just take my way away to the workshop.


168
00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:29.350
IPhone: Close the door, lock the door.


169
00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:29.820
Connor Williams: Yep.


170
00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:31.279
IPhone: And they won't tell me for 2 hours.


171
00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:40.180
IPhone: And then when I come out, I'll just… I'll just… my gaffe has to say, oh, sorry, I was plodding on with this, they don't need to know what I'm doing. I don't care. I don't care what they think I was doing. Do you know what I mean?


172
00:18:40.180 --> 00:18:55.550
Connor Williams: Well, my roadmap is to get someone in a role within 90 days. They're usually doing it, you know, earning commission within 3-4 months. Most people quit 4 to 5 months in, and then 6 months, you know, they're in a position of full-time, they've got, you know, the skills they need, and they can start scaling up.


173
00:18:55.670 --> 00:19:08.279
Connor Williams: So what I aim for, for someone with no experience, is anywhere between 4 to 6K in the first 6 months. That's a nice, reasonable benchmark for us, but again, it's the 15 hours a week, which doesn't sound like it's unachievable here at all.


174
00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.010
IPhone: You know, I think that…


175
00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:10.860
Connor Williams: Mmm…


176
00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:25.909
Connor Williams: most, probably 60% of the people who join us don't have any sales experience. You know, Connor hasn't had any sales experience, but is absolutely smashing it within his first 5 weeks. He's already on a setting role, because, you know, we focus on closing here, but sometimes we do have a few setting opportunities as well.


177
00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:26.930
Connor Williams: But…


178
00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:36.239
IPhone: that is something I am prepared to do as well. Like, I just want to go in there and just take as much information as I can. Yeah. And I suppose if you've got knowledge about the setting.


179
00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:43.539
IPhone: side of it, it sort of makes you know the process a bit more. If you know what someone's done to get to where they're coming to.


180
00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:51.339
Connor Williams: Yeah. You need sales… you need sales skills to set, and it is a good prerequisite, but the thing I don't like about it long-term is that…


181
00:19:51.340 --> 00:20:08.779
Connor Williams: you're usually doing 6 to 8 hours a day as a setter, and you only get 5% commission, that's if the closer closes, and you're constantly working throughout those 6 to 8 hours. But as a closer, you just take the calls around your diary, probably taking 4 to 6 calls on average a day, and you obviously get 10% commission every time you close.


182
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:17.970
Connor Williams: So, there's a little bit more incentive financially, and a lot less work effort, a lot less work rate on the closing side. But…


183
00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:24.930
Connor Williams: you know, I guess the other side of that puzzle, like we were speaking about, is, alright, we've got a clear destination we want to reach.


184
00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:30.979
Connor Williams: what about the reason that we're here in the first place? Because, you know, if you take a step back.


185
00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:37.890
Connor Williams: like we said, normal people don't do this stuff. Normal people are happy, like, most people would be happy at 3K a month.


186
00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:38.740
IPhone: Yep.


187
00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:41.460
Connor Williams: So I guess the real question is, why are you not?


188
00:20:42.150 --> 00:21:01.400
IPhone: I just want more to show for my time. I'm in a situation now where I've had to move house. I'm in this absolute mess. I mean, the wallpaper's falling off as I'm sitting here. So, before I left home, once I got that, I bought a mental car. I love my cars.


189
00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.300
Connor Williams: What you got?


190
00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:04.450
IPhone: I've got a Mercedes A45.


191
00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:06.069
Connor Williams: Okay, yeah, yeah.


192
00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:10.539
IPhone: AMG, and it's the best thing I've ever bought, but it's come to a situation now where I physically cannot afford


193
00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:13.049
IPhone: And I've got to give it back.


194
00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:14.320
Connor Williams: I didn't.


195
00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:20.259
IPhone: not one to give it back, but it's things, and my dad was saying, well, it's part of growing up, and I was like.


196
00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:38.980
IPhone: But it isn't. I was like, I was like, you should be able to go to work, you should be able to get what you want, when, like, when you want it. But obviously, this small-town mentality, like I was saying, it's just the normal. It's just… it's just what people do, and then they're stuck in this cycle. So really, I just want to be able to do what I want.


197
00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:42.159
IPhone: when I want to do them, I want to put as much effort into this as I can.


198
00:21:42.210 --> 00:22:01.720
IPhone: Job satisfaction, I mean, it's fair enough saying I've closed the deal for £500, but the adrenaline rush I'll get off doing that… Oh, it's a good buzz, yeah. I'll be… I'll be shouting in the kitchen, I'll say, look at this, look at this! But yeah, that's why in the long term, short term, just match my salary.


199
00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:06.430
IPhone: And if I'm happy doing it, then, like I was saying to Connor yesterday, I will want to get to the 10.


200
00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:07.000
Connor Williams: Yeah.


201
00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:10.660
IPhone: and beyond. But… and I will quit my job.


202
00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:15.720
IPhone: But I just want to live a life that I want to live there. I don't want to have to show up on someone else's time.


203
00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:18.239
IPhone: I just want to get up, do what I do.


204
00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:22.540
IPhone: Do what I need to do in terms of the sales.


205
00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:26.560
IPhone: And then enjoy myself, and that's… that's just what I want to do.


206
00:22:26.910 --> 00:22:36.290
IPhone: I mean, I'd be lying if I told you all I want to do… all I want to do is close 24-7, but… because that's not true, I just want something to allow me to have the life that I want.


207
00:22:36.290 --> 00:22:36.880
Connor Williams: Yeah.


208
00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:38.310
IPhone: If you know what I mean.


209
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:51.879
Connor Williams: Yeah, you know, there's nothing more frustrating when people say, what's going to sort your life out is sitting there with a budgeter, and not paying £10 a month for Netflix, and going a little bit cheaply on your shopping. No, that doesn't fix your life, it just keeps you in poverty.


210
00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:52.580
IPhone: Yeah.


211
00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:55.830
Connor Williams: What fixes your life is stepping the fuck up and doing something about it.


212
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:56.530
IPhone: Yep.


213
00:22:56.530 --> 00:23:04.200
Connor Williams: like so many people have been able to do, but you're right, this small-town mentality, the expectation is crabs in a bucket. No one wants to see anyone make it out.


214
00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:18.299
Connor Williams: So, look, I mean, it is unfortunately a common story, but I think it is the one that really ignites this journey for a lot of people. It certainly did for me. You know, knowing that there was more out there, my biggest problem was just


215
00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:30.009
Connor Williams: having the path to follow, you know? Like, you know, I tried a few things, I didn't really have any guidance, it was kind of a very messy experience, but when I found the thing that I actually enjoyed, when I had a bit more of a structured path.


216
00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:44.119
Connor Williams: that's when these things really started to happen. So, I think that if we've got the right reason to be here, if you're confident, then that is what it takes. Like I said, the sales training's gonna take you longer to go through than someone with a few years' sales experience, of course it is.


217
00:23:44.120 --> 00:24:03.759
Connor Williams: But some of the best people I've ever worked with have come in with no experience whatsoever. They just had the right reason to be here, and they had the consistency to stick to the path. What I also like about yourself is that, you know, you can work this in around work. It's not like we're working a 10-hour day, and then we have to get back, and then we have to do learning, and then on top of that.


218
00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:19.480
Connor Williams: So I think we're in a good position here, I think you're here for the right reasons, and I think you're gonna, yeah, you're gonna love what we do here. So, what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna share my screen, and I'm gonna take you through the academy, but if you're on a phone on portrait, because I have, like, an ultra-wide screen.


219
00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:30.650
Connor Williams: If you knock it on the side, you'll probably… yeah, it's a little bit clearer. I'll just… I'll just pick it up and use it here. Doesn't look professional, but I'm gonna have to. Have you got a laptop?


220
00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:33.850
IPhone: No, but after this call, I'm shooting for Cries to buy one.


221
00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:46.150
Connor Williams: Yeah, I got mine on it. What I would say, though, don't splurge on a laptop. Like, has all this RAM and stuff like that. As a closer, you just need internet connection, and that's it. So…


222
00:24:46.320 --> 00:25:01.330
Connor Williams: I got one, that served me very well, called a HP Envy. It was about 750 quid. Really, really good laptop, kept me going for a very long time. I got a 3 gram Mac here, and I hate it. So…


223
00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:08.979
Connor Williams: Cool, well, let me share my screen, bud, and let's, let's kind of go through what this all actually looks like. So…


224
00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:14.199
Connor Williams: 1… There we go. You should see…


225
00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.179
IPhone: Yep, I'm on, yep, that's it.


226
00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:17.820
Connor Williams: See the Closed Pro Academy here?


227
00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:18.440
IPhone: Yep.


228
00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:23.830
Connor Williams: Cool. So yeah, this is the Academy. So, we've got a lot of different things in here. We've got…


229
00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:37.390
Connor Williams: one-on-one, we've got group, we've got community, we've got course content, we've got structure, but really, everything together is what's going to get you into a position as a closer. And if you, you know, like I said, if you do look at the people that we've helped with this.


230
00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:44.579
Connor Williams: I don't know if you've managed to see this already, but, you know, just to kind of share the experience that people come into this space with, like, Jay…


231
00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:53.020
Connor Williams: He could talk to anyone, and he ran barbershops. Hannah, high-paying corporate job. Steve was a takeaway owner.


232
00:25:53.020 --> 00:26:12.920
Connor Williams: Shannon, Luke, Meganna, Joe, all come from sales backgrounds, but Ethan, one of my guys who's at over 20K a month, actually put a post about him today. He was a PT before this. Charlie, marketing assistant. Luke, no sales experience. He was in the NHS for 11 years, you know? Lisa, stay-at-home mum for 20 years. So…


233
00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:25.369
Connor Williams: it is not imperative that you come into this process with sales experience. What is imperative is you come into this with that level of commitment to stick to this path, give it the consistency.


234
00:26:25.770 --> 00:26:41.959
Connor Williams: And if you can do that, you know, there is absolutely no way that this won't work out. You know, we even have a guarantee that someone gets into remote sales, which, touch wood, we've never had to give anyone their money back, because everyone has stuck to the path, but a big reason for that is us being a bit selective who we take on.


235
00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:54.460
Connor Williams: Because I want this community to be fueled of motivated, committed people that connect to each other, go through this journey together. So, you know, if you know Connor, you'll kind of know the style of people that we take on board here, but…


236
00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:55.050
IPhone: No.


237
00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:57.490
Connor Williams: In terms of mentorship.


238
00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:05.600
Connor Williams: you know, the reason that I've called it a mentorship program is because, you know, I've built this workspace to kind of manage the journey on with you.


239
00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:25.530
Connor Williams: And I operate on two principles. So, clarity and accountability. So, with clarity, what I mean is that you do literally get a step-by-step thing to follow from the moment you join me, all the way to learning the skills, getting yourself into your first role, closing, and what you'll see in this is that there are one-on-one calls with me throughout this entire process.


240
00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:29.720
IPhone: That's exactly what I want as well. I think that'll help me the most, to be fair.


241
00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:35.889
Connor Williams: Yeah, because even things like this, like, let's say you've got your first offer as a closer. It's not like, right, see you later, mate, good luck.


242
00:27:35.890 --> 00:27:36.999
IPhone: Yeah, not a chance.


243
00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:54.179
Connor Williams: But before you even take a call, me and you are jumping on a one-on-call to make sure you're ready. When you're taking calls, we go through call reviews to make sure that you're still closing at a good rate. So, again, it is guidance, and it is full one-on-one throughout, but the aim to get you in a role within 90 days, which is 12 weeks.


244
00:27:54.340 --> 00:28:09.490
Connor Williams: What we also do is accountability every step of the way. So what that actually looks like is that week on week, we're going to develop a plan of action. I want you to tell me how many hours that we're gonna plan this week, what group calls we're going to jump on, and then we're going to set targets.


245
00:28:09.490 --> 00:28:16.859
Connor Williams: And I mean, like, right, I'm gonna reach this stage in the content, or I'm gonna do this many roleplays, or I'm gonna reach out to this many people, whatever it comes down to.


246
00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:36.630
Connor Williams: And then, more importantly, you're gonna review that week, I'm gonna go through with you, and you're gonna tell me how far away you were from targets, how your energy was, how much your hours you put in, if there's any additional help you need, because this is the side where I am a mentor who believes in the truth, is the only thing that's gonna… guys, sounds like a cliche, isn't it.


247
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:40.019
IPhone: To be fair, I like that. I like… I like someone that'll just call a spare a spade with me.


248
00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:40.730
Connor Williams: Yeah.


249
00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:43.950
Connor Williams: Maybe it's my military background, but… Yeah.


250
00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:52.720
Connor Williams: if you are not hitting targets, and you're selling me you're missing targets each week, and you're not doing your hours, I'm not gonna say everything's alright. I'm gonna say, look, why are we even fucking here?


251
00:28:53.110 --> 00:29:05.849
Connor Williams: But, if you're exceeding targets every week, we're like, right, how do we build on this? How do we capitalize on this momentum? How do we set more ambitious stuff? So, this is how people get through this process, because I'm guiding them through every single step. But.


252
00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:24.049
Connor Williams: In terms of what that actually looks like to get you in a role, we're gonna go through 3 stages. So, I'm gonna set you up first, I'm gonna teach you sales, and then I'm gonna finally secure you a role as a closer. So, the reason we start in setup, essentially, it's the biggest reason people don't get placed as a remote closer.


253
00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:32.659
Connor Williams: Because if you don't know how to come across as a professional, you know, position yourself in the right way, then no offer's gonna want you to be the face of their business.


254
00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:52.759
Connor Williams: So, rather than what 90% in this industry do, just put random holiday photos up and just spam people on Instagram, we don't do that. We position ourselves as professionals. But even the entrepreneur side, how do I pay myself? How do I set up a business? Or how do I set up myself self-employed? All of that stuff we teach you. So, there's no doubt on what you're doing when you get set up.


255
00:29:52.810 --> 00:30:08.039
Connor Williams: Next, and most importantly, is sales as well. So we have an elite-level sales training program here where we give you a complete deep dive into not only higher-level sales skills, but also all the practical skills you're gonna need as a closer. And…


256
00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:15.279
Connor Williams: what I'll also say is I teach sales a little bit differently. You know, my own style of sales is called New Age Sales, and it's essentially…


257
00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:26.649
Connor Williams: a very opposite approach to old school. I don't want you to be pushy. I don't want you to force people into doing things, because as, Mary, as you've already experienced, how did that make you feel as a prospect?


258
00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:29.290
IPhone: I hate editing. Yeah.


259
00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:29.900
Connor Williams: Exactly.


260
00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:30.250
IPhone: I just…


261
00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:34.390
IPhone: because he was a bit pushy, I just didn't trust him. Everything he said just went out the window.


262
00:30:34.390 --> 00:30:35.050
Connor Williams: Yeah.


263
00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:51.939
Connor Williams: So, when it comes down to selling, it's about you being the authority that someone trusts to make the right decision with them, not being pushy and trying battling an objection handling. So, the psychology of all that is what we deep dive into, but like I said, you need the practical skills as well as the soft skills, so…


264
00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:56.809
Connor Williams: what we teach you is my Master Sales Framework, and this is essentially a step-by-step


265
00:30:56.890 --> 00:31:13.059
Connor Williams: on how to run a sales call. And I also show you by example. So I'm going to show you me doing this in live examples. You're gonna learn each step, we're gonna write these things out together until you know how to write a call. We're gonna go through objection handling so you know how to battle objections if they do come up.


266
00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:19.449
Connor Williams: And then when you've learned the theory, as we said earlier, the practice is even more important. I mean, do you do any sports yourself?


267
00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:23.379
IPhone: I've currently… I've had to stop playing Rook because I've got a.


268
00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:24.290
Connor Williams: Oh yeah, of course.


269
00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:27.590
IPhone: hart.


270
00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:33.019
Connor Williams: I mean, my sport was always boxing, so I'll be having another couple fights this year at some point, but…


271
00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:37.430
Connor Williams: it's not like you can watch Mike Tyson and then step into the ring.


272
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.810
IPhone: costs.


273
00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:56.480
Connor Williams: So you can learn the skills, but it's all about practicing them in a safe environment where you can make the mistakes, then you can figure out how to do it, and then that is when we get you into a role. So, once you feel comfortable and confident closing, that is when we're going to secure you a role. And like I said, the reason that we guarantee this is because we do it properly.


274
00:31:56.590 --> 00:32:07.590
Connor Williams: I need to first show you how to find these businesses that you can work with, and also how to vet them. Because not every business with a high ticket offer is necessarily going to be the right one to close for.


275
00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:27.440
Connor Williams: So, finding them, vetting them, but getting in front of them as well. You know, I've seen this from every angle. I beat 650 people to get my role as a closer. I've built countless sales teams for my business, other people's businesses, so I kind of know what you need to do to navigate this space, what you need to say, how you need to come across, what these people are actually looking for.


276
00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:40.990
Connor Williams: But also, you know, the biggest way we get people placed is in the network. So, we've got opportunities that you can apply straight in for within our network, so again, there's just no way that you won't get placed. But, as I said earlier.


277
00:32:41.050 --> 00:32:46.359
Connor Williams: the training is important, because even if I give you an opportunity, it's like, right, this guy wants a closer.


278
00:32:46.360 --> 00:33:04.079
Connor Williams: So, I'm gonna send them your way, give them, you know, give you a nice warm reference. Doesn't mean you're gonna slot straight into that role. You're still gonna need to show up, talk to them before they give you that position. So this is why we go through all of these things properly, but again, this is why we make sure that you've got everything at your disposal.


279
00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:05.080
Connor Williams: And…


280
00:33:05.370 --> 00:33:15.640
Connor Williams: What you get lifetime access to, other than that kind of coaching, is this community where we've got over 150 people on the same journey as you.


281
00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:26.850
Connor Williams: on the same path, same mindset. We do group calls together four times a week, we do live events together, we do meetups, you know, everything here, so you feel like you've got a sense of community.


282
00:33:26.850 --> 00:33:39.059
Connor Williams: As well as, obviously, the one-on-one with me. So, that is the Academy, man. So, I've got, yeah, more than enough time to dive into that any deeply that we need to, go through questions, yeah, whatever you need, man.


283
00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:43.629
IPhone: Yeah, so… I know you touched on there, about the setup of the business and that.


284
00:33:44.250 --> 00:34:03.000
IPhone: I haven't a clue, like, I know you said you'll help me through it, but that's one of the main things, like, I've never done anything in terms of setting up my own business. I wouldn't even know what article it's on, don't have a clue. I've actually got a few questions written down, I don't know if I can go off this and stay on with it. Yeah, I can.


285
00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:03.870
Connor Williams: Yeah.


286
00:34:03.870 --> 00:34:09.450
IPhone: So, my first question to you is, what is the main thing, do you think, that makes people feel.


287
00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:10.790
Connor Williams: I know what you said.


288
00:34:10.929 --> 00:34:11.590
Connor Williams: Always.


289
00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:12.100
IPhone: themselves.


290
00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:19.619
Connor Williams: You know, it's getting in your own way, it's overwhelming yourself with simplicity. You know, it's that analysis paralysis.


291
00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:34.780
Connor Williams: You know, most people think they need more information to make a decision, but what happens most of the time is more information overwhelms them, and then they can't make a decision. So, messy action is going to be perfect, perfect strategy every single time in this space.


292
00:34:35.179 --> 00:34:47.879
Connor Williams: So, things like that, when you're deciding to set up a business, like, I literally just jumped off a one-on-one call with one of the new guys, and we had this exact conversation. He spent 2 days trying to think of a business name.


293
00:34:48.370 --> 00:35:04.000
Connor Williams: when I said the only people who are ever going to see your business name are the companies you're closing for and you invoice. You could literally have your initials closing limited, and it wouldn't make a difference. So, there is no such thing as perfect. What is happening is you're just overwhelming yourself and you're procrastinating.


294
00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:10.769
Connor Williams: So, it is that overwhelm, it is that analysis paralysis that holds a lot of people back, because…


295
00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:19.540
Connor Williams: When you get used to failing, and you stop seeing it as a bad thing, and you start seeing it as a good thing that you invite, you get through processes.


296
00:35:19.690 --> 00:35:26.949
Connor Williams: Five times quicker than most people, because when there's two types of people, one who just goes head first, fucks up, learns, and gets through.


297
00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:39.840
Connor Williams: He does something on a Monday, learns it's wrong on a Monday, fixes it, applies that on a Tuesday, and has not only gained more skills, knowledge, and experience, but has progressed in 2 days. Then you get the other type of person.


298
00:35:39.870 --> 00:35:47.019
Connor Williams: who sees something on a Monday, thinks about it on a Tuesday, goes back to the first thought on a Wednesday, changes his mind on a Thursday.


299
00:35:47.050 --> 00:36:01.850
Connor Williams: puts it off Friday, Saturday, Sunday, goes onto it again Monday, and then finally makes a decision that goes wrong, and then they re-adapt. So, most people who kind of have that attitude, they get things done in a week that other people can get done in a day. So I would say.


300
00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:05.750
Connor Williams: the top, top one that I see, personally, is probably that.


301
00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:12.639
IPhone: Right. So, of all the people you've caught, then, I think it's over 200,000, I think, I think, can you think?


302
00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:24.270
Connor Williams: Yeah, so, one-on-one between this and then the offer that I was closing for, I was also a coach, so I was teaching people how to sell, with their marketing agencies. So, over about 2,500 people.


303
00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:29.270
IPhone: So, out of all them people, That have been successful.


304
00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:32.909
IPhone: Well… What trait do you think stood out?


305
00:36:33.370 --> 00:36:35.210
IPhone: To make them successful.


306
00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:37.390
Connor Williams: Consistency is one of the top ones.


307
00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:38.180
IPhone: Right.


308
00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:44.640
Connor Williams: So, people who can work on discipline rather than motivation is always one of my top ones.


309
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:50.239
Connor Williams: And the kind of the messy action over perfect strategy is a massive one as well.


310
00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:54.030
Connor Williams: But… You see what you believe in life.


311
00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:58.590
Connor Williams: And… When someone sees something like this…


312
00:36:59.170 --> 00:37:07.609
Connor Williams: they'll either see it more one way than the other. And when you look at things like this, with more of an optimistic attitude.


313
00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:16.839
Connor Williams: of what if things go right, and I can be here, and then you get the other side that's like, what if things go wrong, and then I fuck up, and then…


314
00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:19.490
Connor Williams: You're always gonna see what you believe in life.


315
00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:25.060
IPhone: And people, like, there's two people see the same thing, and see two things completely different, so…


316
00:37:25.060 --> 00:37:31.999
Connor Williams: It's the people that… Have almost that… Delusion of what's possible.


317
00:37:32.390 --> 00:37:50.080
Connor Williams: they're the ones who always do the best. Because, you know, when I was a business owner at the start, and I failed at my first one, I lost 20 grand in two years, it's completely delusional for me to try again, because I've already got evidence that says I can't do this. But I tried. I failed. Completely delusional for me to try the third thing.


318
00:37:50.080 --> 00:38:06.249
Connor Williams: Which actually worked, and you know, I got to 10K within about 3 months of my agency, but then it kind of worked, and then it kind of failed. So, the next one, again, so there has to be this delusion about what's possible, but you cannot be delusional about what it takes to get there, the work ethic side.


319
00:38:06.490 --> 00:38:10.750
IPhone: Yeah, to be fair with you, I think I've got that down, to be honest.


320
00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:12.500
Connor Williams: Inter…


321
00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:19.289
IPhone: I'm not… I'm not trying to put an effort in. To be fair, it'll spice my day up, to be fair.


322
00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:20.325
Connor Williams: Yeah.


323
00:38:21.610 --> 00:38:23.659
IPhone: I have got one more question that I've written down.


324
00:38:24.110 --> 00:38:28.140
IPhone: And… Is there anything from day one


325
00:38:28.570 --> 00:38:30.979
IPhone: If, hopefully we can get this done today.


326
00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:32.880
IPhone: That is an absolute must.


327
00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:35.599
IPhone: You're gonna say consistency again, I think you sort of answered that.


328
00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:36.820
Connor Williams: Yeah, is the…


329
00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:37.260
IPhone: Good.


330
00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:48.510
Connor Williams: It is the action. Like, the thing is, is that words are so fucking easy to say, and, like, words almost become a bit of an illusion, because when you feel pain of your current situation.


331
00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:59.819
Connor Williams: when you say words that I'm going to fix it, what it fixes is that pain you feel in that moment, and then as soon as that pain goes, you stop thinking about it, you stop worrying about it, you stop doing anything about it.


332
00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:16.969
Connor Williams: And then when it comes up again, you say you're gonna do something about it again, and then it solves the pain just enough for you to go back in. And that cycle repeats for a lot of people. So, you have to get used to even ignoring your own words, and just not even saying it, just doing it. Like, actions are the only thing that solves the problem.


333
00:39:16.970 --> 00:39:19.840
Connor Williams: Words are the only things that solve the pain in that moment.


334
00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:24.060
IPhone: Right, I'm with you 100% on that as well, from my side.


335
00:39:24.490 --> 00:39:25.470
IPhone: So…


336
00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:31.429
IPhone: I think the only question is now is, are you happy with me? In terms of what you've heard, and…


337
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:46.760
Connor Williams: Like I said, the logical side of you can work this around your job is a massive plus, because that's sometimes the biggest thing that holds people back. They are out of the house for 12 hours, they get home, they're fucked, and they dwindle off. So that's a big one that I am…


338
00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:54.689
Connor Williams: more aware of nowadays. Just the fact that you haven't got any sales experience doesn't tie into this at all, but if you're confident


339
00:39:54.990 --> 00:40:03.560
Connor Williams: speaking to people on a Zoom call, that's the prerequisite. Where people struggle is they don't really like having those sorts of conversations, and it's like.


340
00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:12.030
IPhone: Why are you trying to become a closer? Well, that's all you're going to do on a day-to-day basis. Connor also said some very nice words about you as well, which obviously does go a long way.


341
00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:25.010
Connor Williams: Because he's been, you know, in the top percentile of type of people to do this. Like I said, like, people like him, who just absolutely throw themselves in. I mean, he's proven it with the actions, right? He's quit his job, he's gone all in, so…


342
00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:28.399
Connor Williams: Not that I'm expecting you to quit your job tomorrow, by the way.


343
00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:31.860
IPhone: I'm hoping to get there, I am hoping to get there.


344
00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:50.980
IPhone: Like I said to you earlier in the call, I don't want to try and run before I can walk. I'm fully aware that when I go into this, I'm going to be useless. But it's quite exciting, to be fair, like, if I look back and, like, I texted Connor last night, I said, in a year's time, hopefully I can say that was the best cup of coffee I ever went for.


345
00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:59.339
IPhone: Yeah. And hopefully these, I'm praying of these, I just… Yeah, that's where I'm at.


346
00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:07.319
Connor Williams: Yeah, well, like, from my side, I'm 100% confident. So, yeah, like, I don't have any doubts from my side, anyway.


347
00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:11.950
IPhone: Right, spot on. So the question is, really, are we doing this? And my side is yes.


348
00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:24.810
Connor Williams: Yeah, well, 100%, man. So, look, the investment side, the process, what that actually looks like. So, the investment for the full program is 5K, so that's all the one-on-one, the guarantees, everything like that.


349
00:41:24.810 --> 00:41:36.410
Connor Williams: When someone joins, what we usually do is we get them set up, we do an onboarding call with them, like, the day after, and then we just build the roadmap from day one. The most important thing for me, like I said, is the person.


350
00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:40.010
Connor Williams: Then just wanted to get absolutely tied into this, so…


351
00:41:40.090 --> 00:41:59.329
Connor Williams: I do always offer a bit of an incentive. If someone gets set up straight away, then I do offer them £1400 off. So, rather than 5K, it would only be £3,600. So, if we can do it today, it would be the 36, but if you do need to go in tiny knots, do whatever, mate, as Connor unfortunately had to, because he was away at sea at the time, it will just be the full 5.


352
00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:09.700
IPhone: Nice, let's do it. I've already done the… compare the market loan search, so it's already all set up. I just need to confirm it. So…


353
00:42:10.350 --> 00:42:19.649
IPhone: We can do that on call with you now, or we can go off, and I can get the loan, and I can pay for you. I don't know if you've got, like, a link to the payment plan, or… not the payment plan, but, like, the payment side of it.


354
00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:25.560
Connor Williams: Yeah, so what do you need to do to get the… do you need to go and clear the loan?


355
00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:27.209
Connor Williams: Or do you need.


356
00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:33.960
IPhone: I've done the search, I've been pre-approved for the £3,000 loan, so I can get it, and I will get it. I'm just…


357
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:38.469
IPhone: I'm not sure how long it takes to come through. When I did it last time, it came through in about 5 minutes.


358
00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:47.790
Connor Williams: Oh, okay. Yeah, sometimes it's very inconsistent. Yeah. So, well, what we could do is… I could take the 600,


359
00:42:47.910 --> 00:43:00.469
Connor Williams: I can get you set up, we'll get you logged in, we'll book the onboarding call for tomorrow, I'll have to share my screen again and show you what you need to do before that call anyway, and then you can take care of the free when that comes in. Would that work?


360
00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:02.259
IPhone: I don't have 600 pounds.


361
00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:07.849
IPhone: If you'd just stay on call with me for about 2 minutes.


362
00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:09.510
Connor Williams: Yeah, yeah.


363
00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:11.650
IPhone: I'm gonna see if this comes through now.


364
00:43:11.650 --> 00:43:15.860
Connor Williams: Yeah, what I'm doing now, I'm gonna chop my coffee up, and then I'll let you, just crack on.


365
00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:16.510
IPhone: Yeah, no worries.


366
00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:17.780
Connor Williams: One sec.


367
00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:32.660
IPhone: So…


368
00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:12.779
IPhone: Accepted, it's just processing. This could take up to 60 seconds. Right, your money is on its way. Oh.


369
00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:16.309
IPhone: Let's see if it actually is on the way.


370
00:45:16.750 --> 00:45:21.769
Connor Williams: Jesus, right, well, I'll need to get this ready then. Right, let's have a look.


371
00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:31.769
Connor Williams: Yeah, well, Connor is… how was he? I think he's 5 weeks in, so I guess the question is, are we gonna catch him up?


372
00:45:32.130 --> 00:45:34.599
IPhone: That's it, 4 grand in. Crazy, that was quick.


373
00:45:34.990 --> 00:45:35.630
Connor Williams: You know?


374
00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:39.479
IPhone: It's so easy to get money, but it's so…


375
00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:41.909
Connor Williams: Quick to be, quicker to…


376
00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:42.729
IPhone: Good civilian.


377
00:45:42.730 --> 00:45:43.210
Connor Williams: as well.


378
00:45:43.210 --> 00:45:44.390
IPhone: And, yeah.


379
00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:46.080
IPhone: Right, yeah, that's in.


380
00:45:46.570 --> 00:45:49.079
Connor Williams: Cool! Well, let me,


381
00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:53.830
Connor Williams: The email you booked the call with, is that the best one to get all yours set up with?


382
00:45:53.830 --> 00:45:54.780
IPhone: it easier.


383
00:45:55.500 --> 00:46:00.619
Connor Williams: Cool, so… I've just sent you over the link on email, it's just a link.


384
00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:14.200
Connor Williams: And I'm just gonna get all your agreement with everything written down, get you logged in, and then I'm gonna share my screen again, and we're gonna book a call in for tomorrow. Are you working tomorrow?


385
00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:15.010
IPhone: I am.


386
00:46:15.010 --> 00:46:16.100
Connor Williams: What time you back?


387
00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:19.120
IPhone: I'll be back about half past two, work 6 till 2, so…


388
00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:22.970
Connor Williams: Nice. Yeah, well, we'll have some space tomorrow.


389
00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:28.790
Connor Williams: Afternoon, later, or evening. Let me just get all this up.


390
00:46:30.750 --> 00:46:32.059
Connor Williams: Did that come through?


391
00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:33.710
IPhone: It is, yes, I'm currently filming it out.


392
00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:34.739
Connor Williams: Oh, there we go.


393
00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:38.380
Connor Williams: Mine, let me just look at all your stuff here.


394
00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:55.879
IPhone: This is the only thing that I've been on in the past 6 months that doesn't let you do apple beer.


395
00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:56.790
Connor Williams: Need Apple Pay.


396
00:46:56.790 --> 00:46:59.129
IPhone: No, it's on, I can get my car details, it's fine.


397
00:46:59.770 --> 00:47:08.549
Connor Williams: Do you know what, you're the… you're, like, the third person in the last week, out of all the new people who have needed Apple Pay, and for some reason, it's come off.


398
00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:11.310
Connor Williams: We have got another link that works with Apple Pay, but…


399
00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:14.510
Connor Williams: I didn't think you could do, like, four grand in one go on it.


400
00:47:14.510 --> 00:47:18.910
IPhone: Yeah, I thought it… I could have sworn it was £100 max at some point.


401
00:47:18.910 --> 00:47:19.830
Connor Williams: That's what I thought.


402
00:47:19.830 --> 00:47:22.929
IPhone: Yeah, but then apparently you can go onto your…


403
00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:25.629
IPhone: Your account now, and you can up it anyways.


404
00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:28.840
IPhone: To whatever you want, which is terrifying.


405
00:47:29.890 --> 00:47:34.099
IPhone: Isn't it… 11, 27, 16, 2…


406
00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:36.849
Connor Williams: What's your last name, mate?


407
00:47:38.490 --> 00:47:41.310
IPhone: Hanlon, H-A-N-L-O-N.


408
00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:44.910
Connor Williams: H-A-N-L-O-N.


409
00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:45.430
IPhone: Yeah.


410
00:47:46.610 --> 00:47:49.869
Connor Williams: Cool, and I've got GaryJames99live.co.uk, yeah?


411
00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:53.069
IPhone: Which is weird, because I was born in 2001.


412
00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:53.940
Connor Williams: Yeah.


413
00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:56.670
IPhone: Moving the up…


414
00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:02.270
Connor Williams: I think I used to have a Facebook that said I was a couple of years older.


415
00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:06.740
IPhone: Yeah, everyone… I did the same. I made it a couple of years older so you could get on Facebook.


416
00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:07.540
Connor Williams: Yeah.


417
00:48:09.430 --> 00:48:10.430
Connor Williams: Right.


418
00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:16.059
Connor Williams: Well, there we are on the fifth.


419
00:48:17.050 --> 00:48:19.820
Connor Williams: 2… 26…


420
00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:28.190
IPhone: I've just approved.


421
00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:43.310
Connor Williams: There you go, guys.


422
00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:51.279
IPhone: So… I don't know what's happening here. It's… I'm getting to the point where it says approving the app.


423
00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:55.349
Connor Williams: And when I'm going over to the app and I come back, it just keeps saying payment unsuccessful.


424
00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:58.710
IPhone: Before I've told the… told it that I've approved it.


425
00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:03.389
Connor Williams: I haven't got… usually I'll… I'll get, like, a… it got…


426
00:49:03.390 --> 00:49:06.670
IPhone: If you're unable to authenticate your payment method, please choose a different payment method.


427
00:49:06.940 --> 00:49:08.770
Connor Williams: Do you want to try the Apple Pay one?


428
00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:10.189
IPhone: Yeah, can do.


429
00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:13.939
Connor Williams: Yeah… Let me just…


430
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:21.129
IPhone: Is that gonna be through another link?


431
00:49:21.290 --> 00:49:22.220
Connor Williams: Yes.


432
00:49:22.220 --> 00:49:23.910
IPhone: Yeah, I'll have to just…


433
00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:46.860
Connor Williams: There we go. Just sent it on your email again there.


434
00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:00.680
IPhone: What else is on for you today, then? Have you got any more calls that you've got to do?


435
00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:11.100
Connor Williams: Yeah, well, we do our weekly coaching call at 6 on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, so… yeah, I've got an hour admin catch-up now.


436
00:50:11.570 --> 00:50:16.580
Connor Williams: Although, I did say I was gonna try and nip to the gym, so… I might squeeze that in now.


437
00:50:18.670 --> 00:50:28.699
Connor Williams: Right. And then, yeah, and then we always do our evening calls. I have half of my week is late because of, obviously, the US, so I've got a couple of guys, this evening.


438
00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:29.599
Connor Williams: So I won't come.


439
00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:29.920
IPhone: Obviously.


440
00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:30.440
Connor Williams: till 9.


441
00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:32.830
IPhone: So that should've… that's confirmed on my end now.


442
00:50:33.070 --> 00:50:34.200
Connor Williams: Right, so look.


443
00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:43.729
Connor Williams: There we go, officially, I should say welcome to the team, man!


444
00:50:43.730 --> 00:50:45.380
IPhone: Thank you very much, I'm excited.


445
00:50:45.630 --> 00:50:48.129
IPhone: Cool. I'm terrified at the same time.


446
00:50:48.130 --> 00:50:51.589
Connor Williams: Do you know what, mate? We had a… we had a conversation the other day of…


447
00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:54.260
Connor Williams: If you, you know, if you're doing things that don't…


448
00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:58.090
IPhone: terrify you at some level, then you're probably doing the wrong things. Yeah.


449
00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:02.539
Connor Williams: So, right, you've just got your membership agreement sent over.


450
00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:09.499
Connor Williams: So let's get you… so what you need to do is you… as soon as you sign that, you'll then get a link to join the program.


451
00:51:10.210 --> 00:51:16.420
Connor Williams: And then tomorrow, while you're just doing that, like, let me just go through the times I got. So I've got…


452
00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:24.050
Connor Williams: to be fair, I've got a space between 3pm and 5pm open tomorrow, so… where's… where's good to do an onboarding call?


453
00:51:24.050 --> 00:51:25.580
IPhone: Bang in the middle, we'll do 4.


454
00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:26.360
Connor Williams: Yeah.


455
00:51:27.130 --> 00:51:29.429
Connor Williams: Let me send you our biggest link as well.


456
00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:31.349
Connor Williams: So we've got that booked in.


457
00:51:36.700 --> 00:51:39.030
Connor Williams: Yeah, I think Connor will probably be keen to…


458
00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:41.139
Connor Williams: Hear how you got on as well.


459
00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:48.200
IPhone: Yeah, I messaged him yesterday saying, I'm on the call with him tomorrow, I said, I'm nervous, and he was like, don't be nervous, he's sound.


460
00:51:49.330 --> 00:51:54.700
Connor Williams: Yeah, so what was the one with that set and one like? You said it weren't him, it was one of his, kind of, team?


461
00:51:55.720 --> 00:51:56.780
IPhone: The what, sorry?


462
00:51:56.780 --> 00:52:01.190
Connor Williams: You said you'd done one with, like, a setting company. Was he… was he bad the whole way through, or was it just towards the end?


463
00:52:01.190 --> 00:52:09.269
IPhone: I know, he was a good fella. I was having a conversation with him about it all, and I think it was about 45 minutes.


464
00:52:10.390 --> 00:52:27.039
IPhone: And I thought, this seems ideal, but then it got to the payment, and then I said, I'll go and think about it. He said, yeah, no, he said… he said, we can do payment plans. I said, I said, that's… I'm not… it's not an issue with the money, I said, because he was always… I was going to get a loan anyway, because I didn't have the money.


465
00:52:27.370 --> 00:52:33.220
IPhone: And then he was messaging on Instagram, saying, can you fill this out, pal? I need to do my daily report before half nine.


466
00:52:33.730 --> 00:52:35.450
IPhone: And I was, I was like…


467
00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:40.360
IPhone: Just by you saying that makes me not want to do it, do you know what I mean?


468
00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:46.690
Connor Williams: Yeah, yeah, it's a shame. It is a shame.


469
00:52:46.950 --> 00:52:47.800
Connor Williams: But…


470
00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:48.440
IPhone: No.


471
00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:49.030
Connor Williams: You'll be on…


472
00:52:49.030 --> 00:52:49.420
IPhone: visual.


473
00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:50.809
Connor Williams: We'll be on the other side of that soon.


474
00:52:51.130 --> 00:52:52.540
Connor Williams: I'm trying to close people.


475
00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:55.700
IPhone: I should, I should ring him back and say, I've got time with someone else.


476
00:52:56.660 --> 00:53:01.930
Connor Williams: Right, you should get another email that's confirming our call tomorrow at 4 as well.


477
00:53:03.070 --> 00:53:06.970
IPhone: Right, that's a success, but it isn't taken off the page, that'll still be done, though, won't he?


478
00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:08.240
Connor Williams: Yeah.


479
00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:10.910
IPhone: Acceptance. That's what that's signed.


480
00:53:12.140 --> 00:53:16.890
IPhone: Invitation, Gary onboarding tomorrow, half… half 4, yep.


481
00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:18.550
Connor Williams: Yeah.


482
00:53:18.850 --> 00:53:19.680
IPhone: Zoom.


483
00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:27.420
Connor Williams: Did you get this, the agreement as well? Oh, there it is, yeah. So, you now should get an email straight away that kind of, invites you to the group.


484
00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:29.619
IPhone: Membership agreement signed.


485
00:53:29.950 --> 00:53:33.439
Connor Williams: There'll be another one that says, join the ClosedPro Academy.


486
00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:40.050
IPhone: Oh, yeah, I've seen the one.


487
00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:43.250
IPhone: In fact, you join the community, join now.


488
00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:46.740
Connor Williams: school…


489
00:53:57.590 --> 00:54:00.930
IPhone: I'm gonna go out, I'm gonna have to go out and get some nice pictures of myself, I don't really have any, like…


490
00:54:01.310 --> 00:54:03.680
Connor Williams: Yeah, we'll get Connor to take some of you.


491
00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:06.589
IPhone: Yeah, he's not coming out.


492
00:54:07.550 --> 00:54:10.430
Connor Williams: Right, there we go. So…


493
00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:13.790
IPhone: Yeah, there's me, there's me lap, I'll be crying.


494
00:54:14.610 --> 00:54:17.299
Connor Williams: What's this…


495
00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:18.829
IPhone: Right, join group.


496
00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:21.770
IPhone: Something went wrong. Ideal.


497
00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:23.920
Connor Williams: Good stop.


498
00:54:26.140 --> 00:54:31.079
IPhone: I'd say something's went wrong, but it just went from 159 members to 160, so I don't know if it has.


499
00:54:31.310 --> 00:54:33.839
Connor Williams: You've literally gone straight in.


500
00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:36.770
IPhone: There we are. Oh, there's my little mugshot.


501
00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:38.799
IPhone: Yeah, there we go. Tidy.


502
00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:44.430
Connor Williams: Hey! So, let me share my screen again and just take you through what you need to do before our call tomorrow.


503
00:54:44.430 --> 00:54:45.470
IPhone: Yeah, perfect.


504
00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:52.040
Connor Williams: So… When you get in, you need to go into the classroom.


505
00:54:52.290 --> 00:55:02.520
Connor Williams: into the setup, and you just need to do the start here module. And the most important thing you need to do is just set your workspace up, the thing that I showed you, earlier.


506
00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:10.869
Connor Williams: So, basically, you come in here, you make a copy of it, you share it with me, and then all I need you to do is fill the onboarding form before our call tomorrow.


507
00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:22.909
Connor Williams: But, if you get stuck with anything, you know, you can message me straight away. You can see here that everyone always just comes to me directly, so if you get stuck with anything, just ping me a message as soon as possible.


508
00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:28.779
IPhone: Yeah, can you go through that again, please? Sorry, my screen was zoomed in, so I didn't see what you were actually speaking.


509
00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:33.940
Connor Williams: Yeah, so Classroom, and then Setup, and it's just the Start Here module. Right, okay.


510
00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:37.259
Connor Williams: So yeah, just making sure you've got the workspace done.


511
00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:46.849
Connor Williams: you've copied it over to me, you've shared it with me, but I detail how to do all that in the video as well, so… But, if you get stuck, obviously just ping me a message straight away.


512
00:55:46.850 --> 00:55:47.879
IPhone: Yeah, will do.


513
00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:49.800
Connor Williams: So we're in, we'll look.


514
00:55:49.800 --> 00:55:50.950
IPhone: Ravine? We didn't know.


515
00:55:50.950 --> 00:56:10.180
Connor Williams: forward to this journey, mate. Like I said, all we need to apply is what we've been over, is that consistency. You know, lean on the support you have around you, the community, me, anyone around you, but you've got everything here to just follow this path and make sure that we get out of this job in the next 3-4 months, and we get to the position that we actually want to be in.


516
00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:24.120
Connor Williams: I'm excited. I'll tell you right now, you'll get sick of my name popping up. Look, I say all the fucking time, if you're not the most irritating fucker in my life, you're not using a mentorship correctly. You should be hounding me at every moment, because that's what, you know, what you're here to do.


517
00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:26.739
IPhone: Yep. Perfect. I might be… I'm excited.


518
00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:27.410
Connor Williams: just…


519
00:56:27.770 --> 00:56:31.019
IPhone: Kind of terrified, or… I'm like…


520
00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:33.239
Connor Williams: Yeah, buzz in, man. Well, look.


521
00:56:33.570 --> 00:56:36.920
Connor Williams: for this one, so just keep me in the loop, and we'll be catching up tomorrow anyway.


522
00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:38.470
IPhone: Yep, will do. Thanks for your time.


523
00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:40.760
Connor Williams: Legend. Alright, Zilla, man. See ya. Bye.
