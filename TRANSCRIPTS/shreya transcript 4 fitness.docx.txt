@0:00 - Leeann Davis
Thank you. Awesome.


@0:01 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Where are calling from?


@0:03 - Leeann Davis
Charlie in Lancashire.


@0:05 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Okay, nice. Nice. Okay, awesome. Well, look, I'm looking forward to jumping on in this call with you. I have spoken to Jess, and I do have a couple of notes in front of me.
But really, what we're going to do on today's call is just go through a few clarifying questions on what your main struggles are, what your goals are in terms of fitness, and just to see if we can help.
If I'm 100% sure that we can help you, I'll invite you onto the programme, build your plan and show you what that looks like.
If for any reason I feel like I can't help, I'll still put you in another direction.


@0:34 - Leeann Davis
How does that sound? Yeah, yeah. Perfect. Thank you. Perfect.


@0:37 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Awesome. So, yeah, the best place for us to start, Leanne, is what made you, or where do you feel like you have been struggling the most at the moment?
Like, where do you feel like you need the most support in your fitness journey?


@0:48 - Leeann Davis
Basically, like, knowing what foods to eat, like the right foods, obviously, if you're not putting the weight on. I did used to go to the gym.
I've not been to the gym for about four or five months. I've recently moved. It's developed more now. It's never been like, well, it has been flat, but it's never been like it is now anyway.


@4:09 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Yeah, and I know you mentioned confidence. How else is it affecting you at the moment?


@4:15 - Leeann Davis
Just how I feel in myself. Yeah, how I feel in myself. I've never, like, obviously not nice. I don't like it.
I just don't like it.


@4:30 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Hmm. When you say not nice, what do you mean?


@4:34 - Leeann Davis
Like, when I look at myself, it's not nice for me to look at.


@4:38 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Hmm. Hmm. Okay. So just to understand, have you ever felt incredible in how you look in the mirror before?


@4:45 - Leeann Davis
Like, was that, is that that mean a time? Yeah, when I used to go to gym, obviously five times, five times a week and that.
Like, yeah. And then obviously, I had a bad domestic violence relationship, basically. So, and ever since then.


@5:04 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Okay, I appreciate you opening up about that. So, ever since then, is that when you started going to the gym, or was that when you started increasing the weight?


@5:13 - Leeann Davis
Well, before, it's hard to explain, obviously. It obviously brought my cheekbone in four places, fractured my jaw, fractured my eye socket.
Obviously, like, once got rid of it, didn't go to the gym for a bit, and then obviously something happened, and he started terrorising me again.
So, the court case, and then ever since then, I've basically not been back to the gym in these past, like, four or five months.


@5:42 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Right, I'm really sorry to hear that, Leeann. That sounds really tough. How are you doing at the moment, in terms of, like, you...


@5:49 - Leeann Davis
Alright, because he's back in prison.


@5:52 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Okay, no, okay. So, I guess then, for you, like, I know you mentioned that the weight is more in your belly area.
For yourself at the moment. Is this weight showing up for you in any other area of your life at the moment?
Like maybe in the clothes that you wear? Like I know you mentioned you have kids. Is it showing up in any way?
Yeah, yeah.


@6:12 - Leeann Davis
Obviously the clothes that I wear, I'm just cautious. I wear either the Spanx or the all-in-one bodysuits that hold your belly in.
Yeah.


@6:24 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
How long have you been wearing those for?


@6:27 - Leeann Davis
About four months.


@6:29 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Wow. I mean, I think I've tried them a couple of times and they're not very comfortable, so how are you finding them?
not.


@6:36 - Leeann Davis
Yeah.


@6:38 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Are you wearing that every day? No, if I go out, obviously, and then I wear it.


@6:43 - Leeann Davis
If I'm in the house, because it's only me and my son here.


@6:46 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Other than that, if I go out, yeah. What's your son's name? Brandon.


@6:52 - Leeann Davis
Brandon, nice.


@6:53 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
How old is he?


@6:54 - Leeann Davis
He's 21, my youngest. Oh, okay.


@6:57 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Okay. I was going to say, like, is it showing up for you with him? But...


@8:00 - Leeann Davis
And on a weekend for the past, I'd say two months.


@8:04 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
So yeah, but like when I go in town like once or twice a week, yeah. Okay, okay. And I know we mentioned that it's not hugely comfortable, but when you are covering it up, like how do you feel?
Like I know it's hidden, but is that helping you in any way?


@8:21 - Leeann Davis
Yeah, kind of, obviously, like, because it does hold you in, but then obviously when you take it off and it just like comes, all your gut comes out, that's when it's...


@8:36 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Yeah. Yeah.


@8:37 - Leeann Davis
When that happens, like, how do you feel when you're like taking it off and you just see it kind of come out?
Yeah, I don't like it. Obviously, it depresses me. I suffer, obviously, with anxiety, depression and PTSD, so it doesn't help me, like physically.
Like, I know I have, like, insecure, like, just, I don't know. It's hard to explain.


@8:58 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Yeah. Yeah, no, I... I understand. I mean, I would love if you could be, like, open and, like, completely open with me.
I understand it's quite hard, so I do understand that. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, okay. So, I mean, it sounds quite tough in terms of what you've been through and what's going on at the moment, especially, like, if you're now taking that off and you're getting to a position where you're feeling a bit depressed looking at your stomach.
I guess, like, I know it's been happening for the last four months, but what kind of triggered you to realise that you need to now do something, like, to make, like, a permanent solution for it?


@9:30 - Leeann Davis
Because I'm not feeling comfortable in myself, and I know that there's only, obviously, me who can do something about it.
The more I put it to the back, I'm just making matters worse, aren't I'm not, like, targeting the issue.
Yeah. But how to go about it, I'm not, like, 100%. Yeah.


@9:49 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Was there something that triggered you?


@9:52 - Leeann Davis
No, it's just, obviously, how I feel, like, personally, like, in myself. Like, I'm not happy in, like... So nothing to it.
So I've always struggled in that aspect of like toning my belly.


@11:07 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
OK. And I know you mentioned that after Brandon, you were going to the gym, right? So you were at a point where you did lose that stomach again.


@11:16 - Leeann Davis
Yeah. OK. What did you do at that time? A lot of cardio, obviously, like sit-ups and things like that.
But I was doing it five times a week.


@11:28 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Hmm. OK. And did you feel like that was the one thing that definitely helped?


@11:35 - Leeann Davis
Yeah. OK.


@11:38 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Yeah. Sorry, were you saying something? I think I might have cut you off.


@11:42 - Leeann Davis
I don't know.


@11:44 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
I don't know.


@11:45 - Leeann Davis
My memories, honestly, if I could like, my memories, absolutely. I think it's, I don't know. Obviously, through the domestic violence, but I don't like talking about it much, obviously, because then it puts me.


@11:57 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Yeah. So I probably said, but.


@12:00 - Leeann Davis
Block it out, but I knew I had to say something, it's trying.


@12:05 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Yeah, no, I appreciate your openness and honesty, Leanne. So right now, why do you feel like you are struggling in particular with the weight?
So is it just because you haven't been able to go to the gym for five, like for a long time now?


@12:18 - Leeann Davis
it's obviously like the food, like even though like I can, I love a salad and that, but obviously I must be doing something wrong.
I don't know, like say I have my breakfast, sometimes I don't have dinner, but I do have tea. Like, so it's not like I eat loads, but for some reason, it doesn't seem to be budging.


@12:41 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Okay. Okay. So what is your, like, I know you mentioned that sometimes you have, sometimes you don't have dinner, but you have tea, right?
So what is your whole approach to nutrition at the moment? Like, do you have any meal plans? Are you like doing anything in particular?
No, not, not really.


@12:57 - Leeann Davis
Like in the morning, I'll probably have an omelette. So I'm with a tiny bit of cheese in, that's it.
Don't really have dinner unless, if I do, it's probably a sandwich, if that, or a sausage roll. And then tea, like it could be, like tonight we've had chicken, key eyes and chips, that's it.
Okay.


@13:19 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Why do you feel like you can't get your nutrition to a point where you can lose the belly fat?


@13:25 - Leeann Davis
Because I don't know what, like, I don't understand the carbs and the protein or how much you're meant to, like how many calories you're meant to eat in a day.
But that's the part where I do really struggle with, I've never like got my head around that.


@13:43 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Okay. So you said you've never got your head around that, does that mean like throughout your whole life you never really understood the nutrition?


@13:49 - Leeann Davis
Yeah, I've never, yeah, because no one's really like told me like about it. Like I eat fruit and I know obviously what kind of food.
So it's mainly like tea meals or say like if the families have been at McDonald's or, you know, anything like.
Yeah.


@14:12 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Yeah. OK. And like you mentioned that you haven't necessarily known for the whole of your life. Have you reached out to anybody for nutritional advice to actually get it to a stage where you can sustainably lose weight?


@14:24 - Leeann Davis
No, because even when I've signed up to gyms, it's like they don't really tell you like what to eat or that.
They basically just open the doors for you to go to the gym and that's about it. Unless you pay for obviously coaching one on one, whatever.
And then they'd probably guide you that way.


@14:48 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Yeah. Has that been something that you ever wanted to consider, like coaching for it? Because that might help in terms of the nutritional aspect.


@14:58 - Leeann Davis
I've never really thought. Because when I used to obviously go to the gym, I used to think about, obviously I was paying for the membership at the same time.
And then the other gym before that, that weren't really a decent, it was just like a backstreet gym.


@15:22 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Okay. Okay. And so you mentioned you haven't reached out to like a coach or you haven't had any support, right?


@15:29 - Leeann Davis
No. Okay. And have you had like a PT or no? No, no. Okay.


@15:34 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
So when it comes to your workouts at the moment, I know you mentioned that you haven't gone to the gym for a couple of months or five months.
What are you doing currently?


@15:43 - Leeann Davis
I still obviously do a bit of a workout at home, probably three times, three or four times a week the most.
Like mainly for my legs, arms, like obviously I do me like sit-ups and that. Yeah. Um, and obviously the leg scissor things, uh, but that's about it really.


@16:07 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
I hear you, and that's all at home, right?


@16:10 - Leeann Davis
Yeah, yeah. Okay, and are you finding that's helping in any way at the moment? Uh, it helps obviously my legs and, um, obviously my glutes and that, but like other things, I don't know what else to, like do, like my sonny does have a weight bench and obviously I use the dumbbells.
Um, but it's different for a guy, you know what I mean? Obviously a guy wants, like, as much muscle and I don't want, I just want to be toned.
That's it. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I got you.


@16:42 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Okay, so when you were like, back in the day when you were hitting the gym five times a week, um, and you were eating, like, what, what, what were you eating?
Were you eating kind of anything or were you just kind of going with the flow?


@16:53 - Leeann Davis
Um, well, like, obviously in the morning I used to have an omelette or, and then probably dinner I'd have.
Probably a bit of salad with some boiled eggs, probably a bit of fruit, and then a tea.


@17:05 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Okay, fairly healthy. Okay, that's fairly healthy. So, I mean, even at that point where you were going to the gym five times a week and you were eating like that, you mentioned that you still hadn't got to a point where you felt like 100% in your figure.


@17:21 - Leeann Davis
Yeah, always struggled with me, my stomach, always. Okay, okay.


@17:28 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Okay. I mean, to me, Leanne, just, that's, like a, structure is a big thing, right? You need to have the right workouts and the right nutrition optimised to what you want to do in terms of losing that fat and your stomach area as well as, like, to lean up.
I guess I'm just curious, like, why do you feel like Lifestyle Lean could be the right people to help you?
Because I know you mentioned you haven't actually reached out to coaches before.


@17:49 - Leeann Davis
No, because I've been watching her videos and I've obviously seen, like, the transformation from all the other, like, women, and they're not just, like, all young women, they're obviously, like...
Women my age as well. So I think, obviously, it's caught my eye. Yeah.


@18:06 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Obviously, because she's a woman as well.


@18:12 - Leeann Davis
Yeah, okay.


@18:14 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Yeah, I hear you, Leanne. mean, look, if you're feeling confident that this might be able to work for mean, I'm interested in where you think it can take you.
Like, what would your dream vision be in, let's say, the next six months from now? What's, like, ideal weight you want to be at?


@18:28 - Leeann Davis
To probably lose a stone and just be more toned, just look healthier, feel healthier. Yeah.


@18:38 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
But you mentioned look healthier. Like, to you, what do you mean specifically by that?


@18:42 - Leeann Davis
Um, like, I've always had, like, a problem with putting weight on. Like, it's a big issue to me.


@18:52 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Do you mean, when you say, sorry, yeah?


@18:54 - Leeann Davis
Even, like, through, like, counselling for the domestic violence, it's, like, even with... I've had counselling through, like, the fear of putting, like, it's hard to explain, because I've obviously my childhood and that.


@19:08 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Okay, yeah, now I hear you. And you mentioned even feeling healthier. At the moment, do you not feel healthy?


@19:16 - Leeann Davis
Like, what about it right now situation? I feel obviously horrible in myself with how much weight I've put on.


@19:25 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Okay. So when you say you feel horrible, is that, like, internally affecting you in any way? Like, your energy levels or anything like that?


@19:33 - Leeann Davis
Yeah. Yeah. And obviously with winter doesn't help neither, does it, really?


@19:39 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Okay. I think it saves me depression anyway. Yeah. Okay. So with the, like, low energy levels, like, do you feel like that's kind of, is that affecting anything you do in your day-to-day at the moment?


@19:55 - Leeann Davis
Yeah. Obviously, I can't be bothered doing that. And obviously before when I was going to the gym, I was...
I up every morning, you know, breakfast, off to the gym, like, and now I've just not really got the, like, I do my workouts at home, but have I got the, like, before I do it, I'm like, you know, but once I start doing it, I'm all right, it's just getting up and doing it, should I say.


@20:17 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Yeah, okay, are you struggling with actually getting yourself to work out at the moment?


@20:21 - Leeann Davis
Yeah, I know, I do do it because I have to force myself to do it, right, but it's, like, late afternoon, like, if I'd have been, I'd have done it first thing in the morning.


@20:33 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Yeah, okay, I got you, and, I mean, if we just go back to the goals then, in terms of you wanting to put, put more weight on, do you mean more healthier weight, not necessarily under stomach air in other areas?


@20:45 - Leeann Davis
No.


@20:46 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Okay, so when you say put weight on, what do you mean?


@20:50 - Leeann Davis
No, I didn't say put weight on, to lose about a stone.


@20:55 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Oh, sorry, I thought, I thought you said put weight on, which is why I was a bit like, you want to lose a stone.
OK, OK, let's scrap that. That's my hair going bad. OK, so, so, OK, you want to lose a stone.
That's roughly like a dress size.


@21:11 - Leeann Davis
So in saying that, like, what's like the one thing you'd want to, you'd want to wear which you aren't able to wear at the moment?
Um, probably one of, I've got, um, like a mousse lover, like, nice fitted dress. And obviously when I put it on, if I put it on with the Spanx, yeah, it does hold you in.
Like, but you can still see, you know, at the top of where the Spanx is. Um, and I'd like to obviously wear that.
I used to be able to wear it without wearing the Spanx.


@21:40 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Yeah. How long ago did you, did you wear that without the Spanx?


@21:45 - Leeann Davis
Oh, last year, year and a half ago.


@21:48 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
OK. OK, that's a, that's quite, like, a decent amount of time not being able to, like, wear it comfortably.
OK, so, so when we're at the stage, we're in six months' time, where you're wearing that lovely... Structure, accountability, and then being able to maintain it.
And I'd say the good news is that this is all achievable. And the logical timeframe, bless you, the logical timeframe for you to get to losing one stone would be six months.
And to be honest, we have helped a lot more women drop a lot more weight in six months as well.
So I definitely say that is the good news. There obviously is bad news. And I think that for you would be that there's a reason that a lot of people can't do it, right?
And that's just because they don't really, they're not really serious about it, right? Everyone wants a good body. But out of 100 people, how many people do you actually see with a good body?


@23:41 - Leeann Davis
Not really many.


@23:44 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Yeah, yeah, you're right, it's just because so little people prioritize it. And I guess what I want to make sure is that this is something that we can do for you.
So I guess for you, maybe if you help me out here, give me a number out of 10. How much of a priority is it for you to...
Roadmap. So that will structure the exact training you need to lose that body fat every single week in a sustainable way.
And that's as long as you can commit to working out at a minimum of three times a week. Is that something you feel like you can do?
Yeah, definitely.


@26:15 - Leeann Davis
Awesome.


@26:15 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
So I know you mentioned that you're obviously working out at home at the moment, which is perfectly fine. A lot of our ladies on the program, they're like working moms, you know, they're there, they have a lot of commitments, they're not able to get to the gym.
So they are working out at home and still seeing huge, huge, huge differences. Yeah. So what would happen is that you get paired with a coach, and that coach will basically set these goals out for you once they understand your schedule, what equipment you have at home, you know, what area, what you have basically available at home for you, what your goals are.
And with doing that, this is what's going to make it a lot more achievable for you. Does that make sense?


@26:51 - Leeann Davis
Yeah, perfect. Thank you. Okay.


@26:53 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
So look, Leanne, even if we get your workouts dialed in, it would be very pointless unless you are eating correctly.
Yeah, that's why we will also structure and educate you on your nutrition. And that's going to be around the foods that you love and that you enjoy, so that you can maintain these changes around your lifestyle.
Right? Especially when you're going out, you're seeing your friends, like whatever it is, you're going to be educated on making the right decisions.
So you are able to sustainably lose that weight. Yeah, yeah. I know you mentioned you are unsure about the calories you should be eating, the macros in terms of carbs and protein.
What they will do is that they will literally give you the exact meal plans once they understand your nutritional preferences, and that's what you then eat, right?
And that's what's going to help you sustainably lose that weight.


@27:40 - Leeann Davis
Right. Do you feel like that will help you?


@27:41 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Yeah, definitely.


@27:43 - Leeann Davis
Yeah. Awesome.


@27:44 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Okay. So, Leanne, look, even if we create you that perfect roadmap, if you don't stick to the plan, unfortunately, you won't achieve it.
Yeah. Yeah.


@27:51 - Leeann Davis
know. If I don't put, yeah, then nobody, yeah. And I do understand I have to do it myself and I am willing.
I know I can do it. I just need. That, you know.


@28:01 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Yeah. Yeah.


@28:04 - Leeann Davis
And that's exactly where we mainly support you.


@28:07 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Okay. You will be kept accountable. And that's throughout the whole process. So every single week to lose body fat, and that will be through check ins and us coaching you on how to adjust your habits, so that we can also educate you to lose that weight and keep it off for good.
Okay. Yeah. So that'll be through our app. And that'll be programmed and structured around you. So you'll have those check ins every single week to make sure you are on track to hit that goal in six months where you have lost all that belly fat, you've lost that stone, and you are able to wear that, that moose lover dress that's in your cupboard without wearing that Spanx.
I know.


@28:40 - Leeann Davis
And I can breathe wearing it.


@28:43 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Exactly. So when you're seeing like these changes happen in you, like every single, well, when you're seeing this every single week, this is what's going to end up building that momentum for yourself.


@28:52 - Leeann Davis
Ultimately, that consistency, and then that lifestyle change, you will then be able to maintain throughout.


@28:57 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
So whether you change by going to the gym, like, like, If you actually end up going to the gym or if you stay at home, you're then able to actually sustainably keep that weight loss going forwards and then maintain that as well.


@29:07 - Leeann Davis
Yeah.


@29:07 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
So we at Lifestyle Lean just want to ensure that you will never need another coach or support ever again, okay?
The habits and education you will adopt here is what's going to keep you lean and sustainably maintain your weight year on year.


@29:21 - Leeann Davis
Yeah. Do you feel like this is kind of what you need? Definitely, yeah. Yeah.


@29:26 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Okay, Leanne, mean, like, how do you feel about the program? Do you feel confident we can help you get to that goal?


@29:31 - Leeann Davis
Yeah, yeah, definitely. Like, I've been watching a page for quite a bit now and I have noticed, like, I think it was my daughter who was, like, told me about her.
So, and obviously I've been watching it because you don't know whether it is all, like, because people do, like, put fake pictures up in that and they've seen it and it's, you can just, yeah.
Like, she's obviously amazing at what she's done and it's not all young people as well because I think the old...
The get, the more you struggle to lose the weight or to tone up.


@30:06 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Yeah. So what happens is when you get older, your body's obviously changing, right? So you need to approach it differently, which is what the team and our coaches are helping the ladies do, because we obviously understand that whatever you did, like when you were younger, that's not going to be the same stuff you need to do now.
Exactly. Exactly that. So do you have any questions on or any other questions on the programme? Or do you want me to kind of run into the numbers for you?


@30:29 - Leeann Davis
Yeah, you can do. My phone's going to literally die soon. It's on 3%. Okay, you can run in.


@30:35 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Do you have a charger anywhere near you?


@30:37 - Leeann Davis
I have to put it on docking station because the cable thing where you put the wire in doesn't work.


@30:45 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Can you like hold it up like that?


@30:47 - Leeann Davis
I don't want to lose you. Yeah, it's charging now.


@30:59 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Yeah. Awesome. Hopefully you don't strain your arm doing that. So did you have any questions or do you want me to run into the numbers?


@31:07 - Leeann Davis
No, you can just run into the numbers, please.


@31:09 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Awesome. Yeah. So, Leanne, from everything we've been through, to lose one stone, we would logically need six months to lose that.


@31:16 - Leeann Davis
And that's four months to lose that stone in the first place.


@31:19 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
And then two months is all about that maintenance so that we can build the habits and then be able to keep that weight off for good.
So to join us for six months, it can be done in two different ways, either a monthly payment of £2.97 or upfront of £1,500.
So the package does save you £300.


@31:37 - Leeann Davis
Right. So, Leanne, one last question.


@31:42 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Are you finally ready to feel like your best self?


@31:46 - Leeann Davis
Yeah, yeah, 100%. The only problem is about the payment. When would I have to make the payment?


@31:55 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)

@32:43 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)

@33:01 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Yeah. I mean, even if it's something that you want to start in March, what we can do is secure your space.


@33:07 - Leeann Davis
Is that something you'd want to consider? Yeah, definitely. Yeah. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. So for that, it just might be before March, but if not, I know I've got till March that answer.


@33:21 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Yeah. OK, that's perfectly fine. So, Leanne, what we can do is we can secure it. It would just be with a 10% deposit, but it is refundable.
OK, so it's just to secure that space. And then once you have the balance, whether you're going for the monthly, whether you're going for the upfront, because it does save you 300, we can then either take it off or basically make the difference.
ACTION ITEM: Call family member re: 10% deposit; if secured WhatsApp Shreya to proceed on Zoom - WATCH

just wanted to see if I can help. Thank So if you feel like you can get the deposit from a family member, then what I would then suggest is you can drop just a message, but I'll also message you on WhatsApp.
And then if when you're ready to make that deposit, just message us back and then we can kind of get you a procedure from there.
Yeah, that would be perfect.


@34:17 - Leeann Davis

@35:00 - Leeann Davis

@35:03 - Shreya Lifestyle Lean (Lifestyle Lean)
Okay, perfect. So what I'm going to do is I will send you a Zoom link, it'll get sent to your email, I'll also drop it to you on WhatsApp.
So what we can then do on that call is if you have the deposit money, then we can work through the deposit.
I'll basically go through it on Zoom with you instead of just sending you a link because it'll just be easier.
