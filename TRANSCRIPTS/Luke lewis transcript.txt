1
00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.160
Connor Williams: Hey, man, are we in?


2
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:37.180
Luke: Hi, mate.


3
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:38.090
Connor Williams: There we go.


4
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.899
Connor Williams: Yeah. How's it going, bud? You all good?


5
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.579
Luke: Yeah, I'm good, mate, how are you?


6
00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:51.829
Connor Williams: Yeah, not too bad, man, not too bad. Looking forward to going through. So, Connor told me a little bit about what you guys had spoken about.


7
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.030
Connor Williams: So, I don't know too much, obviously, I've got the application you filled in.


8
00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:04.490
Connor Williams: kind of gave me a little bit of a kind of spiel on how you two know each other, what you've been talking about, but how much have you seen about Close Pro and what I do?


9
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.820
Luke: To be honest… In regards to what you do.


10
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.470
Connor Williams: Very minimal.


11
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.619
Luke: But I know… The… the basic gist of…


12
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:27.090
Luke: high ticket sales, etc. And I've just basically hopped on this call for some clarity, because of…


13
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.630
Luke: Just sort of stepped away from… Trading.


14
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.569
Luke: So I was trading, like, NASDAQ and the S&P, but…


15
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:41.269
Luke: I'm… I'm working, and the times I wanted to trade was New York session, I was…


16
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.390
Luke: it's not feasible for me at work, so I want something that I can sort of, like…


17
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.810
Luke: put time and effort in once I get


18
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.870
Luke: home from work, I'm just weighing my options up at the minute.


19
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.150
Connor Williams: Well, I think the main thing…


20
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.360
Connor Williams: If you have missed anything, I'll kind of detailed a little bit about, you know, what I do within high-ticket closing, so…


21
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:22.709
Connor Williams: I am a mentor in this space, so what that means is that I help people to become very successful high-ticket closers. Yes, we have a very structured process that we take them through. Yes, you know, we guarantee that people are going to be able to get into the space, but that's only because I don't really work with anyone. You know, I want to make sure


22
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:32.439
Connor Williams: If I work with someone, I am 100% confident that they could be very successful in this space. So, what I do want to kind of talk about today.


23
00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:44.600
Connor Williams: It's just a little bit more about, yeah, where you are at, where you want to get to, you know, why are we not there yet, you know, what are really the things that you would need to get into a position, which I'm assuming, you know, we want the freedom, we want the control.


24
00:02:44.610 --> 00:03:00.240
Connor Williams: And, you know, I'll give you a very honest reflection of where I think you're at and what you need. You know, it could be as small as pointing fingers in the right direction, it might be as much as, you know, a full mentorship program, but really, it's about what's going to actually help you out at this point. So, you know, why did you book the call in with me today?


25
00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:07.970
Luke: Again, it was… For some, some sort of guidance,


26
00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.939
Luke: Some more information into high ticket sales.


27
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.930
Connor Williams: And overall, like.


28
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:19.689
Luke: I'm just weighing… up my options. I don't necessarily want to choose the easiest.


29
00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.699
Luke: pathway, but I want to choose what's… what's going to suit me better.


30
00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.260
Connor Williams: Yeah.


31
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.820
Connor Williams: Best going forward, if that makes sense.


32
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.820
Connor Williams: And just, just take me back a little bit, though. So what are you doing for a job?


33
00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.380
Luke: So, at the minute,


34
00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.940
Luke: Have you… I'm on a nuclear power plant.


35
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.220
Connor Williams: Okay, cool.


36
00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.899
Luke: So, I'm a… Decommissioned… it's under decommissioning, so I'm a technician on there.


37
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.049
Luke: It's long days, so I'm up at half 4 in the morning.


38
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:50.580
Luke: Yeah.


39
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.940
Connor Williams: Yeah.


40
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.809
Luke: Don't get back home till half 4.


41
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.550
Luke: But…


42
00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:01.569
Luke: I tend to put my phone down. I go to the gym. I tend to put my phone down when I come back, get a shower, and just…


43
00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.680
Luke: And just… Stodigue.


44
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:05.530
Connor Williams: Yeah.


45
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.770
Connor Williams: What are you, what are you studying?


46
00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.750
Luke: At the minute, I'm going through countless… AI automation.


47
00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:22.430
Luke: videos, I'm going through high ticket sales in, I'm constantly on with ChatGBT,


48
00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:31.660
Luke: friends, LinkedIn, just trying to reach out to people, getting… get myself into all these communities, and I'm just, like, reaching out to people at the minute, just trying to find…


49
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.679
Luke: Good advice.


50
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:37.510
Connor Williams: So…


51
00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:47.689
Connor Williams: why are you even looking at this stuff? Because… I don't know, you know more than me, but a technician on nuclear power plants sounds like a pretty sound job.


52
00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:55.849
Luke: There's no… no… financial freedom in it, there's… there's loads of progression, yeah, it's…


53
00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.709
Luke: When I say financial freedom, I mean…


54
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.100
Luke: It's… it's quite vague for me. I value my time.


55
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:13.609
Luke: as well as finance. I want to be able to be… to an extent.


56
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:23.669
Luke: free, have the freedom of my own time, so work where I want, when I want, as much as I want, as little as I want, and I also want to still have


57
00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:31.800
Luke: steady cash flow. I think it's just everyone… I'm 23, I think it's everyone dreams of this, really. But…


58
00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.819
Luke: I'm just… I'm very determined to make this happen, and I wish I started something sooner.


59
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:44.539
Connor Williams: Yeah, you know, a lot of people want these things, you know, the financial freedom, the time freedom, all of that great stuff.


60
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:55.220
Connor Williams: But there's not a lot of people who do what it takes to get it. So, where does it come into the trading side, and then the agency, and now this? So, how long were you trading for?


61
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:03.310
Luke: I was naive to the whole industry of trading. I first got into signals.


62
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.980
Luke: Learned it was total shit, no one learnt you anything.


63
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.329
Luke: Don't taught you anything, it's just a signal in a chat no one tells you about.


64
00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:19.149
Luke: how much you should be risking. They just say, buy now, you don't get taught psychology. So I did that for maybe…


65
00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.570
Luke: 2 or 3 months, load that…


66
00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.639
Luke: it's not all that, and then I decided to learn it myself.


67
00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:29.649
Connor Williams: A pasta-funded account.


68
00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.170
Luke: So, I was actually eligible to take payouts.


69
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:37.450
Luke: But, like I say, I was probably doing that for about 9 months.


70
00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:38.080
Connor Williams: Yeah.


71
00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.619
Luke: And it's just… it's just not…


72
00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:48.030
Luke: suited to me as the New York session's about 2pm in the afternoon, and I'm working.


73
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.549
Luke: With no access to laptops.


74
00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:55.630
Luke: So, it's just not been, I just want a new sort of path.


75
00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.659
Connor Williams: So, when did you decide to, kind of, deviate from that and do something different?


76
00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.950
Luke: To be honest, not too long ago. Just after Christmas.


77
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.780
Connor Williams: Okay, so, yeah, good month and a half.


78
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.799
Luke: Yeah, yeah.


79
00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:13.440
Luke: Yeah. And how far have we come? Because you say you're doing a few different things at the moment.


80
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.799
Connor Williams: So, what stopped you from picking one and going all in on it?


81
00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.159
Luke: That's a good question.


82
00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:29.410
Connor Williams: Because most of the time, you have the choice in life, you know, you can have anything that you want, you just can't have everything.


83
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:30.140
Luke: Yeah.


84
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:35.839
Connor Williams: So, trying to split your attention, it's like, try and form two committed relationships at the same time, it's never gonna work.


85
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:37.510
Luke: Yeah, that's true.


86
00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:40.890
Connor Williams: So, what stopped you Right, this is my thing.


87
00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:45.149
Luke: I guess I'm still… still weighing.


88
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.529
Luke: up my options, and I just want more…


89
00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:53.740
Luke: information about all the things that I've essentially got in a pot.


90
00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:58.920
Luke: So I've picked a handful of things out, like I mentioned before, and it's just…


91
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:05.940
Luke: I want to know before I dive into something and give it my undivided attention, that it is formal.


92
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:11.420
Connor Williams: Yeah. Well, the unfortunate truth for me is that you will never know that until you do it.


93
00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:18.999
Connor Williams: Because I can tell you how to take your closing's the best thing since sliced bread, but it doesn't necessarily mean it's the best thing for you.


94
00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:26.189
Connor Williams: You can tell me that you are confident if you're at all closing deals, you want all the things that high-ticket closing can give you.


95
00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:44.129
Connor Williams: And, again, we could go down that road and find out that it isn't for us. But the same way, an AI agency is a bit more of a technical-led project. You know, we have to be a lot more technically versed with a few more things like that. It's less communication and more of that side, but…


96
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:52.200
Connor Williams: if all those things tick a box from the outside, there's no way of telling, because I'm willing to bet at some point you thought trading was your future.


97
00:08:52.280 --> 00:09:06.280
Connor Williams: you thought, right, I'm done with day jobs, I've found my path, light the end of the tunnel, because I don't sit here as a successful e-com business owner, even though that was my first thing that I thought was gonna get me out, that I invested 2 years and 20 grand into, and it went almost nothing.


98
00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:14.820
Connor Williams: I also done trading, same thing, thought this was gonna be my thing. I also ran an agency, and I made 10K a month within 3 months. And I thought, that's me.


99
00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:18.320
Connor Williams: But it didn't work out long-term because of how overwhelming it was.


100
00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:31.609
Connor Williams: And high-ticket closing for me was the best thing, because I could just focus on one thing, rather than focus on 100 things, just become highly skilled at it. And then, obviously, since then, the coaching business as well, because it was the thing that I was good at. So…


101
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:40.640
Connor Williams: You're never going to be in a position where you pick something because everything aligns and you know, because you don't know until you do.


102
00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:50.829
Connor Williams: But, are you the type of person that suffers with a bit of analysis paralysis as well? When you have too much information, you don't actually do anything because there's too much information?


103
00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:51.890
Luke: 100%.


104
00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:59.160
Connor Williams: Exactly. So, the more you look into these things, I don't think that that's putting you closer to something. I actually think that's pushing you further away.


105
00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:01.669
Connor Williams: So… Right.


106
00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.570
Connor Williams: What you have to look at when you pick


107
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.200
Connor Williams: For the best judgment of your… yourself.


108
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:12.020
Connor Williams: It needs to be on three things. It needs to be, first and foremost.


109
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:20.609
Connor Williams: Will this VIN give me the life that I want? And that's not just money, because, you know, I've been in positions earning 10K and I've not been happy.


110
00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:28.019
Connor Williams: So, it's money, it's location, it's time, it's lifestyle. So, we need to look at that first.


111
00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:34.759
Connor Williams: The next… Needs to be… Will I actually enjoy the journey?


112
00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:41.240
Connor Williams: Because if you're putting all work in in something you don't really enjoy because you think it's going to get you somewhere you want to be, then you'll never get there.


113
00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:42.450
Luke: Yeah.


114
00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:47.490
Connor Williams: And then the last thing is, would I actually be exceptionally good at it if I stuck to it?


115
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:55.700
Connor Williams: Because if you want, I'm assuming, to go on and do big things in these spaces, 10K months, all that good stuff.


116
00:10:55.870 --> 00:11:03.029
Connor Williams: You don't get to a level of the top 1% of earners in the world, unless you're highly skilled in something, or you produce a lot of value.


117
00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:06.700
Connor Williams: So, let's look at the first option.


118
00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:12.960
Connor Williams: what is it you actually want, long-term? Like, what position do you feel like you want to be in?


119
00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:16.610
Luke: Long term.


120
00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:17.650
Connor Williams: Yeah.


121
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:20.059
Luke: Wanna work myself.


122
00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.189
Connor Williams: Okay, both tick that box, yeah.


123
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:23.110
Luke: Yep.


124
00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:30.289
Luke: Going back to… time freedom again, financial freedom, and I want to enjoy what I do.


125
00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:35.299
Luke: I don't want to wake up and go, ugh, I've got to go to work, I want to wake up and go.


126
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.210
Luke: I get to work.


127
00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:37.820
Connor Williams: Yeah.


128
00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:39.769
Connor Williams: Powerful switch when you start.


129
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.610
Connor Williams: moving those words together. So what do you think?


130
00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:56.299
Connor Williams: is gonna be more enjoyable, and you're going to be better at? Is it the AI side of things, the technical side, and then running a full business, which has more long-term potential, but it will take longer to get there?


131
00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:00.670
Connor Williams: Or, do you want more freedom?


132
00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:13.119
Connor Williams: Because if you are just selling, taking 6 calls a day, you'll have more time freedom. You can make 10, 20K a month, people have gone on to make more, but there's not much scope past the 30s and the 40Ks a month.


133
00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:25.609
Connor Williams: But also, earning 30K, what was I say, 20, on the very top end. At least it's 100% profit, but if you earn 20K of an agency, you're gonna have to start paying staff, and ads, and all that stuff, so…


134
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:27.799
Connor Williams: Agency has more scope long-term.


135
00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:36.439
Connor Williams: But it's gonna be a lot harder work to get there, and you're gonna have to manage not only selling your product, knowing how the product works, managing systems, clients, team.


136
00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:51.120
Connor Williams: Or, where you have less responsibilities as a closer, but you need to be highly skilled in sales, you need to enjoy having conversations like this over Zoom, hopefully selling something that you actually believe in as well, you know, it's going to be health-wealth relationships, those are the spaces we operate in.


137
00:12:51.240 --> 00:13:02.379
Connor Williams: You know, what do you think you actually pull more towards? And I want you to answer me, not based on, right, I really need to think about that. Instinctually, what do you naturally gravitate more towards?


138
00:13:05.070 --> 00:13:06.040
Luke: I know.


139
00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:08.329
Luke: I'll be better.


140
00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:09.940
Luke: A high-ticket closure.


141
00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.669
Connor Williams: Okay. What do you think you'd enjoy more, though?


142
00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:24.570
Luke: Robly. High ticket closing.


143
00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:26.620
Connor Williams: Okay, and knowing that…


144
00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:37.919
Connor Williams: you can get into closing, you can drastically improve your sales skills, you could probably sell something within the AI space to improve your knowledge in that industry, and then go on to build an agency in that space.


145
00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:38.440
Luke: Yes.


146
00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:44.679
Connor Williams: Why do we think we're still teetering, though? Is it that analysis paralysis? Are you just overwhelmed because there's too much information?


147
00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:46.709
Luke: I think so, I think there's…


148
00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:50.909
Luke: Lots of different routes down AI that just interest me.


149
00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:55.460
Luke: And I just wanted to… Saws.


150
00:13:55.790 --> 00:14:00.250
Luke: Understand them all, which you get told from day one not to do.


151
00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:10.699
Luke: to pick one… one… one topic, and just… just, like you say, go all in. I just want to understand them all, and be able to do them. I've sort of neglected


152
00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:14.509
Luke: the advice I've been given, go all in on one.


153
00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:21.960
Connor Williams: Yeah, but is this, do you think, is a bit of a reoccurring problem, though? Are you more someone who likes to try and do things their own way?


154
00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:27.670
Connor Williams: Or, are you able to take the advice of someone who's been there, done that, and is going to show you what to do?


155
00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:31.390
Luke: Both.


156
00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.600
Luke: Okay.


157
00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:36.660
Connor Williams: Explain a little bit more, bud.


158
00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:44.170
Luke: So… I like to do things my own way, I like to try and find my own feet.


159
00:14:45.070 --> 00:14:53.259
Luke: But when I know I'm reaching a dead end, and, like, the circle's just… it's endless, and then I get to a point at the top of the iceberg, that's when I…


160
00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.319
Luke: I take people's advice.


161
00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:59.570
Connor Williams: Yeah. But what do you think is more important to you, doing things your own way, or being successful?


162
00:14:59.770 --> 00:15:01.060
Luke: Being successful.


163
00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.309
Connor Williams: So why are we doing the counteractions to that?


164
00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:08.699
Luke: I just… I just, I just think I'm stubborn.


165
00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:15.410
Connor Williams: Yeah. But… If we're trying to step into the world of success and entrepreneur.


166
00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:16.670
Luke: 100%, yeah.


167
00:15:16.670 --> 00:15:22.050
Connor Williams: being the most stubborn person I've ever known, or ever met, you know, I was exactly the same way.


168
00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:28.730
Connor Williams: the reason my first business failed is I refused to seek help. I could figure out by myself, and I lost a lot of money, and a lot of time, and a lot of…


169
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:33.699
Connor Williams: Blood, sweat, and tears with that. Trading, same thing, I can figure this shit out by myself.


170
00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:38.010
Connor Williams: And then, as soon as I bought a course to help me with an agency, that's when I hit 10K.


171
00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:44.539
Connor Williams: So, it is, yeah, a lesson I wish I would have learned a lot sooner.


172
00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:45.980
Connor Williams: But…


173
00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:55.509
Connor Williams: there's nothing, you know, for me, it was a personal thing, like, I would feel like I'm not good enough if I'm getting help. I feel confident in myself to figure it out.


174
00:15:55.630 --> 00:15:56.959
Luke: I'm on the same page.


175
00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:13.239
Connor Williams: Yeah, but then it is learning that everyone that I start to look at, who I aspire to be, when I start to pay attention to who they were, what they did, how they got, like, the rise of how they got into that position, not modeling what they're doing in that position.


176
00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:28.059
Connor Williams: all of them had a mentor, all of them had help, all of them had guidance. Because if you look at it in a way of, look, there is no doubt in my mind, if you did this, you would be able to figure it out, but you would take a long time to do it.


177
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:32.049
Luke: A long, long time, and you'd have to go through a lot of failing.


178
00:16:32.630 --> 00:16:38.340
Connor Williams: Or, someone can give you the exact blueprint to follow, speed the time frame up by 7,


179
00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:40.920
Connor Williams: And then you're already in the position.


180
00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:55.169
Connor Williams: that you want to be in within a year rather than 5 years. You know, you tell me what… what person is lesser than the other one. The one who seeks advice, gets into a better position quicker, or the one who stumbled by themselves and got overtaken by everyone else?


181
00:16:55.710 --> 00:16:56.510
Luke: Neither.


182
00:16:56.690 --> 00:17:05.980
Connor Williams: Yeah, when I sort of started to see people I knew I was smarter and more capable then outperform me because they were just getting the right help, you know, unfortunately, I had to learn that lesson the hard way, but…


183
00:17:06.119 --> 00:17:17.369
Connor Williams: You know, there's nothing wrong with taking help. I mean, have you ever worked with a mentor before? Not like a coach or a course, but like an actual mentor, someone who is there in your corner, backing you up, giving you this advice?


184
00:17:18.410 --> 00:17:19.109
Luke: No.


185
00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.410
Connor Williams: So how do you think you'd actually be with a mentor?


186
00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.670
Luke: Brilliant. Like I say, I'm driven.


187
00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:30.590
Luke: Once I've got a mentor, I think…


188
00:17:30.990 --> 00:17:33.970
Luke: be very accepting. I'll take calm…


189
00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:37.129
Luke: all the knowledge that they're giving me. I'm like a sponge.


190
00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.699
Luke: Yeah. I absorb everything that…


191
00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:41.419
Connor Williams: I get told some…


192
00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:49.700
Luke: And… That is just so determined. So, like, say, like, you have a time period… I don't know, like…


193
00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:51.950
Luke: It's 3-week.


194
00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:57.800
Luke: deadline of… You need to do all these tasks within 3 weeks.


195
00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:04.970
Luke: I would try and make sure that they're done within 2 weeks, and make sure that they're done to their best, my ability. Do you know… do you know what I'm…


196
00:18:04.970 --> 00:18:08.129
Connor Williams: So, what that comes down to is probably…


197
00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:15.810
Connor Williams: Within the top three, definitely in there. One of the top three traits of a successful entrepreneur, and that's entrepreneurial urgency.


198
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:18.489
Connor Williams: The biggest mistake I see people make


199
00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:28.940
Connor Williams: is, again, that analysis paralysis taking a week to make a decision and take an action that should have really taken an afternoon. So, when I work with people, we literally have…


200
00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:41.079
Connor Williams: weak plans of action with targets to say exactly what we need to be doing. And, you know, that's why I've really appreciated Connor so much, because he doesn't come into this with sales experience, but he's been able to…


201
00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:57.000
Connor Williams: probably double the work rate of most people with sales experience, and get twice as far in half the time. Because, yeah, he's coachable, and he just applies everything straight away, and, you know, that's the stuff that we look for. It is that urgency to get stuff done, because even if, let's say you do something on a Monday, but it's wrong.


202
00:18:57.190 --> 00:19:07.669
Connor Williams: But then you find out why it was wrong, you fix it, and by Tuesday, you get where you wanted to be, versus the other person, who doesn't make a decision until Thursday, because they tried to make the perfect plan.


203
00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:21.090
Connor Williams: Between that. So, if there's the two guys, you know, someone like Connor, who gets most of the week done in Monday, Tuesday, or there's some of the other guys who take two weeks to do something that should have took 2 days.


204
00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:27.289
Connor Williams: what side do you think you are more? The… someone like Connor, or some of the other people who procrastinate?


205
00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:29.720
Luke: 100%. 100%. I mean…


206
00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:36.180
Luke: within reason. Obviously, I've got workload, so it wouldn't be like the example that you say, where it'd be.


207
00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:41.070
Luke: A week's work in one to two days, but it'll definitely, 100%.


208
00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:42.399
Connor Williams: Be ahead of schedule.


209
00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:45.669
Connor Williams: Yeah, well, Connor's actually a rare case for us.


210
00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.869
Connor Williams: In that he's not working at the moment.


211
00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:49.290
Connor Williams: So… Yeah.


212
00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:56.259
Connor Williams: You know, even… even when he's doing twice the hours of what most people do, because we ask for 15 hours a week.


213
00:19:56.390 --> 00:20:07.539
Connor Williams: That's the time that we want from people, because 9 times out of 10, they work a day job, it's about doing it in the evening and weekends, replacing your income, quitting your job, then going in full time. That's the roadmap that we want to build.


214
00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:15.429
Connor Williams: So, most people do that, but even, you know, if you take the 15 hours that Connor applies, he does 3 times as much as what most people do.


215
00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:16.420
Connor Williams: So…


216
00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:16.920
Luke: Yeah.


217
00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:23.049
Connor Williams: Again, it is… it's that… is it… do you think you're more of the action-taker side, or a bit more of the procrastinator side?


218
00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.500
Luke: Action taker.


219
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:28.640
Connor Williams: So, allowing me to just play devil's advocate a little bit here.


220
00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:34.150
Connor Williams: So, if you've been looking into things for 6 weeks, but not really made any serious…


221
00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:34.539
Luke: There you go.


222
00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:41.369
Connor Williams: Are we… are we trying to convince ourselves we're one side, but sometimes we do have a tendency to be the other?


223
00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:43.999
Luke: Wow, I mean, when you look at it like that.


224
00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:56.659
Connor Williams: Yeah. Well, look, my job as a mentor is to unfortunately say the things that most people don't want to hear, but they need to hear to get them past these limiting beliefs. These are the mental blocks that stop 99% of people being successful.


225
00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:05.140
Connor Williams: It's not because they don't think they can do it, it's because your mind literally tricks you. You know, we're really big on psychology, and, you know, part of my transformation from


226
00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:13.059
Connor Williams: absolute nightmare to being able to get here was nearly 18 months out, just focusing on this stuff.


227
00:21:13.270 --> 00:21:27.210
Connor Williams: I had to really address my mindset, my limiting beliefs, the cycles that I kept going on, and I was, like I said, I was a massive proponent of this. I was stubborn, I thought I got loads done, but I was exactly the same. So I know what can go on sometimes. But I guess…


228
00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:33.329
Connor Williams: if you want to change your position in life, you have to change yourself, right? So, are we willing to actually start doing things differently?


229
00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:36.430
Luke: Definitely.


230
00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:52.500
Connor Williams: Cool. Well, look, if… let's say that you did get the right help, you found the right person, you found the right roadmap, where do you actually want to be as a closer? Because, you know, we've used the words freedom, and financial freedom, time, what does that actually mean for you, though?


231
00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:56.360
Luke: In terms of what?


232
00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:57.380
Connor Williams: Well…


233
00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:03.680
Connor Williams: What… so, I mean, financially, what would you need to be doing a month to feel like you had financial freedom?


234
00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.349
Luke: 10K a month.


235
00:22:08.510 --> 00:22:13.399
Connor Williams: Okay, cool. So, solid figure there. So, why 10K, just out of curiosity?


236
00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:20.149
Luke: I think it's just… A staple, like a ball pint.


237
00:22:20.150 --> 00:22:23.449
Connor Williams: It's a level where people take you more seriously, I can tell you.


238
00:22:23.450 --> 00:22:27.980
Luke: Yes, it's an objective in every industry. It's,


239
00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:31.979
Luke: rolled to 10K, my first 10K a month, you see it everywhere.


240
00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:33.300
Connor Williams: Yeah.


241
00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:38.010
Luke: So, I think… 10K a month is…


242
00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:43.800
Luke: I wouldn't say financially free, but I'd say it's… it's… it's…


243
00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:46.400
Connor Williams: You definitely… A lot more freehand.


244
00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:47.100
Luke: Yeah.


245
00:22:47.100 --> 00:23:01.899
Connor Williams: Okay, well, there's obviously so much room people can grow in this space, but I do think 10K is the first serious goal that people need to lay out. Obviously, our first, first goal is to get you out of a day job, and then do this full-time so we can hit the 10K. And how much do you need to replace, by the way?


246
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:07.900
Luke: Devin.


247
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:10.150
Connor Williams: You need to replace 7.


248
00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:12.520
Luke: I'm sorry, 3. three.


249
00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:17.470
Connor Williams: Oh, okay. So, do you know what that looks like, though, as a high-ticket closer?


250
00:23:18.150 --> 00:23:18.780
Luke: No.


251
00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:22.910
Connor Williams: So, you know high ticket is 5K to $25K on average?


252
00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:23.620
Luke: Yeah.


253
00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:25.190
Connor Williams: And you take 10% commission?


254
00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:25.840
Luke: Yes.


255
00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:30.149
Connor Williams: Yeah, so, if we look at that… We are looking at…


256
00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:37.840
Connor Williams: 5K in dollars, even on the worst case, let's be conservative, let's say it's 5K in dollars, you're taking 400.


257
00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:44.890
Connor Williams: for… in pounds for a sale that you make. So, if we need to make… 3K.


258
00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:47.440
Connor Williams: And we're getting 400 a sale.


259
00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:51.539
Connor Williams: And that is going to be 8 sales, sits us at 32.


260
00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:53.650
Connor Williams: Or 3,200.


261
00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:57.570
Connor Williams: Now, the figures behind that you need to pay attention to as a closer.


262
00:23:57.770 --> 00:23:59.850
Connor Williams: First and foremost is your close rate.


263
00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:02.870
Connor Williams: That's how many calls you take, and how many calls you sell.


264
00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:06.520
Connor Williams: So, in this industry, you really should be above 30%.


265
00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.870
Connor Williams: But… Let's say that…


266
00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:23.930
Connor Williams: we're not… we're on an offer where it's not perfect, we've still got to develop our skills, and we're at 20%. So what's that? 5… 5 calls every sale. So you need to have 5 calls to make 1 sale and do 400. So if we said…


267
00:24:24.050 --> 00:24:33.430
Connor Williams: the first goal is 8 sales to get you out of a day job. Well, then we would need to make 40 calls over the course of a month. So that's 10 calls a week.


268
00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:35.249
Connor Williams: That we need to take.


269
00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:37.080
Connor Williams: In order to hit that point.


270
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:38.230
Luke: Yes.


271
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:47.040
Connor Williams: So, you know, I was selling an offer that was 4K, and how I got to, you know, 20K months was because I was closing at 60-75%.


272
00:24:47.320 --> 00:25:05.139
Connor Williams: So, the scope on where you grow, really, you know, I did it when high-ticket closing wasn't a thing. I should have got a more expensive offer, definitely, and that would have scaled me up, but we've got options of increasing sales rate, to take more calls, to do it part-time, to improve your close rate.


273
00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:15.670
Connor Williams: that offer value, all of these things where we can start going up. But for you, you know, where does 10K a month sit in terms of timeline? When do we want to hit that point?


274
00:25:18.610 --> 00:25:19.220
Luke: was…


275
00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:25.179
Luke: As soon as possible.


276
00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:29.739
Connor Williams: Okay, but when is… because as soon as possible, it could mean tomorrow, so…


277
00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:33.530
Luke: I'm happy within… within 2026.


278
00:25:33.850 --> 00:25:35.370
Connor Williams: VIN 2026, okay.


279
00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:36.000
Luke: Excellent. Yeah.


280
00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:37.860
Connor Williams: 11 months max.


281
00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:50.770
Connor Williams: So, if someone comes in with sales experience, we usually draw them out a roadmap of 6 to 9 months. If someone comes in with no sales experience, it is usually around 12 months that we like to, you know, aim for that point.


282
00:25:51.160 --> 00:26:00.450
Connor Williams: People have obviously done it much quicker than that, with no sales experience, sales experience. Ethan, we were speaking about the other day, hit 20K within 12 months, with no sales experience.


283
00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:03.280
Connor Williams: But if you look at the type of people that kind of do that.


284
00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:08.330
Connor Williams: obviously, the challenges for them are always different. So, for you, what do you think


285
00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:12.099
Connor Williams: The main things are that we need to focus on to get you to a point like that.


286
00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:20.050
Luke: Consistency, I think the determination's obviously there.


287
00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:24.340
Luke: And… overall sales.


288
00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:36.140
Connor Williams: Okay, so, I mean, sales training, yeah, nail on the head, that's obviously why you get a sales coach. But the consistency side was an interesting answer. So, I always find the biggest thing I offer here is accountability.


289
00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:40.419
Connor Williams: So do you have any… do you feel like you have any accountability right now?


290
00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:41.490
Luke: 100%.


291
00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:50.290
Connor Williams: Do you feel like you have it now? Accountability? Like, if you… let's say that you set yourself a target of waking up early for a week straight, and you didn't do it. What happens if you don't do it right now?


292
00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:51.969
Luke: I feel like shit.


293
00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:55.349
Connor Williams: So, do you think you're good at holding yourself accountable, or…


294
00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:57.950
Luke: Definitely. Okay. Definitely.


295
00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.749
Luke: Yes, I'm good at holding myself accountable.


296
00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:02.340
Connor Williams: Yeah.


297
00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:15.109
Connor Williams: But, do we feel like an external accountability factor is what we need to have this level of consistency to hit that point? Because you pretty much hit the nail on the head. The most important thing is consistency. It's the biggest thing people lack.


298
00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:25.179
Connor Williams: It's the hardest thing people to… for people to do, but I've always found accountability is a very great asset to help people to do that.


299
00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:26.600
Connor Williams: But…


300
00:27:26.850 --> 00:27:34.010
Connor Williams: I think the biggest, you know, the biggest asset to help you to get to a point of, you know, if we really want to get to 10K by the end of 2026,


301
00:27:34.330 --> 00:27:47.100
Connor Williams: what it ultimately comes down to is you, right? It's how serious you are about hitting that point, because I could tell you, right, I want to be a millionaire tomorrow. I want to do a million in a day, sorry, tomorrow.


302
00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:50.050
Connor Williams: And I'm… I'm gonna do it.


303
00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:55.840
Connor Williams: I can say that, and I can even sound convincing that I want to do that, but does it mean it's gonna happen? Probably not.


304
00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:57.200
Luke: So…


305
00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:06.329
Connor Williams: if you were… I mean, let me get an idea here, so maybe… maybe give me a number, just so I know exactly where we're at. So, 0 to 10, 10 being the most, 0 being the least.


306
00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:10.859
Connor Williams: How serious are you about hitting 10K by the end of this year right now?


307
00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:12.480
Luke: Ted.


308
00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:13.030
Connor Williams: 10.


309
00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:16.060
Connor Williams: Okay, well, I like that there was no hesitation.


310
00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:21.669
Connor Williams: I like that we're, we're straight in there. But, I think, you know, words are easy.


311
00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:23.099
Connor Williams: To say that. 100%.


312
00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:33.250
Connor Williams: the actions need to… need to follow. Like I said, it's that… it's that urgency, it's the willingness to actually just get the things done now, which most people take a week, that you can do in a day.


313
00:28:33.370 --> 00:28:36.710
Connor Williams: You can get done in a month, what most people do in a year.


314
00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:46.129
Connor Williams: And I think we've, yeah, pulled that thread a little bit, that maybe we're not as urgent as we are needing to be for a journey like this.


315
00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:57.000
Connor Williams: So, you know, I mean, what happens if you're 6 months from now? Let's say, you know, we do nothing, we keep looking at AI and this, 3 months go by, and we still haven't done anything.


316
00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:59.619
Connor Williams: I mean, is that something that we're willing to do?


317
00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:01.900
Luke: No.


318
00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:03.630
Connor Williams: Okay, so…


319
00:29:03.870 --> 00:29:15.309
Connor Williams: If everything is aligned then, in terms of what we've been through, I honestly think that if everything you've said is true, there is zero chance that we won't be able to do that.


320
00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:18.769
Connor Williams: If you give the consistency that's required.


321
00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:23.970
Connor Williams: If you take this seriously, and you, again, get out the procrastination


322
00:29:24.090 --> 00:29:27.469
Connor Williams: The analysis paralysis of which most of us suffer with.


323
00:29:28.190 --> 00:29:30.140
Connor Williams: I can't see a reason why this won't work.


324
00:29:30.350 --> 00:29:34.890
Connor Williams: The only thing is obviously making sure that you're in a position to make it work. So I mentioned earlier.


325
00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:36.239
Connor Williams: that roadmap.


326
00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:47.269
Connor Williams: For me, it takes me 90 days to get someone in a role, if they can give me 15 hours a week. We're typically doing 3-4K within the first couple of months, which for a lot of people is enough to leave their job.


327
00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:53.940
Connor Williams: Full-time by month 5-6, and then obviously ramping up from that point, improving skills, maybe even getting a better offer.


328
00:29:54.110 --> 00:30:01.690
Connor Williams: And aiming for that 10K by the end of the year. So, while you are working a job, that 15 hours is not going to be a problem.


329
00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:08.739
Luke: Not at all, like… I've… Saturdays, Sundays, I get in at half or do 2 hours a night.


330
00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:12.269
Connor Williams: Yeah. Most people do 2 hours Monday, Friday, and then 5 hours over the weekend.


331
00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:13.820
Luke: Yeah, that's… yeah.


332
00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:27.179
Connor Williams: Cool. And then, yeah, I mean, the effort side, I mean, don't doubt that we're gonna be able to put the effort in. I mean, the last thing is going to be financially. You know, getting the skills, getting the coaching given, getting what we need to put ourselves into a position like that.


333
00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:35.679
Connor Williams: Because 10K a month is not just going to be an easy ride. So, if you did see a path that you were a hundred, you know, I mean 100% confident.


334
00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:51.300
Connor Williams: that there's absolutely no way if I do this, I'm not gonna be earning 10K by the end of the year. I mean, my usual range, depending on what people need, is anywhere between 2 to 5. Again, it does depend on what people need, and we'll go through that in a second, but…


335
00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:54.679
Connor Williams: If you did see the puff, We're 100% confident


336
00:30:54.860 --> 00:31:01.419
Connor Williams: Are you able, but more importantly, are you willing to put anywhere between those two marks to get to a position like that?


337
00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:05.060
Luke: Yes.


338
00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:13.509
Connor Williams: Cool, well, look, mate, I think you are gonna love the Academy. Did Connor show you anything so far about the actual Academy, or did he just speak to you about it?


339
00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:18.640
Luke: No, nothing, mate, we literally just… He just…


340
00:31:19.250 --> 00:31:22.160
Luke: passively mention your name, said…


341
00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:28.029
Luke: Hop on a call with him, express what you're thinking, get some clarity.


342
00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:31.699
Luke: He's awesome.


343
00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:37.180
Luke: And then let me know what you think of everything.


344
00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:43.219
Connor Williams: Cool. Well, what I'll do, mate, is I'm gonna share my screen, and I'm actually going to show you what the process entails. So let me know…


345
00:31:43.330 --> 00:31:47.780
Connor Williams: when you can see my screen, it should say the Clothes Pro Academy.


346
00:31:48.610 --> 00:31:49.839
Luke: Yes, I can sleep.


347
00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:54.530
Connor Williams: Cool. So… Have you been on to school before?


348
00:31:55.600 --> 00:32:14.310
Connor Williams: Yes. Yeah. Yeah, I know a lot of programs are on here, but we like to be on school, so obviously it's a nice, neat place for us to keep most of the things that we do, but everything that we do, whether it's one-on-one coaching, group coaching, course material, in-person events, you know, the community, everything goes into your success as a closer here.


349
00:32:14.310 --> 00:32:32.180
Connor Williams: the way that I like to lead this, like I said, it is mentorship. I want you to be on the other side of this, on the path to five figures, to be quitting that job, to be in the position that we really want to be in, but I've always found that the mentorship is the only way I can do that. So, within the program, I've built this workspace


350
00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:47.179
Connor Williams: And this is essentially what me and you manage the journey on together. So, I operate on two things. Clarity and accountability. So, when I say clarity, what I mean is that when you join me, there's literally a complete list of things that you do from the moment you join.


351
00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:53.209
Connor Williams: All the way to learning the material, getting yourself into a role, and actually closing in your first offer.


352
00:32:53.640 --> 00:33:03.379
Connor Williams: And what you'll notice here is throughout this process, there are one-on-one calls you book with me. So let's say, for example, you're in your first ever offer. Well, before you even take a call.


353
00:33:03.570 --> 00:33:18.969
Connor Williams: You jump on a call with me, and we make sure you're prepared. We go through scripts, the industry, everything you need to. When you're actually taking calls, we do a call review, make sure that you're actually closing to the best of your ability, give you some more coaching. If I can improve your close rate, I can help you make more money without spending any more time on it.


354
00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:22.669
Connor Williams: So, that's the level of guidance that you get, but also.


355
00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:39.930
Connor Williams: accountability is huge for me. So every week, what we're doing is we're creating a plan of action. What coaching we're gonna jump on, how many hours we're gonna put in at the week, and then we're gonna set targets. And then what I want you to do at the end of the week is I want you to review your week, and tell me how far away from these targets you actually hit.


356
00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:48.549
Connor Williams: So again, if I know you're exceeding targets every week, I know that we need to set more ambitious targets. If I know you're missing it every week, we're probably going to have to have a conversation.


357
00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:49.600
Connor Williams: Again.


358
00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:56.690
Connor Williams: Not that you want to hear it, but definitely that you need to hear it. This is the kick up the arse some people need to just keep them on track.


359
00:33:57.100 --> 00:34:07.979
Connor Williams: And I want to see how you've progressed, how many hours you're putting in week on week, you know, we can go through any support, any questions, and just make sure you have support, guidance, and clarity throughout this whole thing. But…


360
00:34:08.190 --> 00:34:17.410
Connor Williams: Getting you in a role is gonna take 3 things. So, the first 90 days is, you know, where we focus the most. So, we spend 2 weeks setting you up.


361
00:34:17.570 --> 00:34:31.529
Connor Williams: We spend 6 weeks learning the sales, and then we spend 4 weeks actually securing your first offer in high-ticket closing. So, the reason we start with setup is because, honestly, it's the biggest reason people can't get placed in this industry.


362
00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:38.160
Connor Williams: You know, you can message a thousand coaches, but if you're not positioning yourself as a professional, they're never gonna message you back.


363
00:34:38.159 --> 00:34:58.979
Connor Williams: they're not going to take you seriously, and you're not going to stand a chance of actually getting on an offer. So, this is what we cover first. You know, how to be an entrepreneur, paying yourself, using all the tools, business, but more importantly, how do you brand yourself? How do you come across? Even if someone asks you for a CV, how do I write a CV that's geared to this space? Because this is not applying for a 9-to-5 job.


364
00:34:59.130 --> 00:35:11.829
Connor Williams: So we make sure that you're set up in the right way in the first couple weeks, but the main reason we're here is because we want to become elite at sales, and this is why we put you through such a comprehensive sales training program. So.


365
00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:14.680
Connor Williams: I teach sales a little bit differently to some people.


366
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:29.100
Connor Williams: My mythology, I call it New Age sales, just because I want it to be the opposite of old school. So, what that essentially means is that I don't want you to be pushy, I really don't want you to try and force-feed someone something they don't want, they don't need, or more importantly, is not going to help them.


367
00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:47.240
Connor Williams: I want you to spend time with people understanding why they even want to go through your program. Is it going to be the right fit? Can you actually help them? So you're a trusted authority that can guide them into the right decision. You understand the psychology that sits behind sales. What's going to motivate decision, behavior, action, all of that stuff.


368
00:35:47.270 --> 00:35:52.279
Connor Williams: So you can leave this with a lot higher sales skills than most people in sales, but…


369
00:35:52.390 --> 00:36:00.020
Connor Williams: The practicality of you being a closer comes to two things. How do you run calls, and how do you handle objections? So…


370
00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:05.720
Connor Williams: When it comes to running a sales call, do you have any idea, the step-by-step, to run a sales call at the moment?


371
00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:06.830
Luke: Not a clue.


372
00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:11.820
Connor Williams: No worries. Well, even if you're starting fresh, I break down the framework, but…


373
00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:24.389
Connor Williams: every part, I teach you the theory, I show you live examples of me doing it on actual sales calls, so you get to see me selling, there's about 25 of my full calls in here as well, and then we write that part out together.


374
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:32.440
Connor Williams: So, you know how to write a script or a framework for any sales offer that you could potentially be placed into.


375
00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:45.969
Connor Williams: And then, when you know how to actually run calls, handling objections is gonna come up a lot as well. So we've got 3 whole modules on handling objections. But the main thing for me, it's not about the lessons, it's about the practice. Do you do any sport?


376
00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:48.619
Luke: Yes, I do.


377
00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:50.409
Luke: Football and boxing.


378
00:36:50.410 --> 00:37:01.900
Connor Williams: Okay, boxing. Man of my taste. So, I've boxed for quite a long time now, you know, I've had a few fights, I had a couple more last year, hoping to do a couple more this year, but…


379
00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:04.300
Connor Williams: As you know, you can't watch


380
00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:09.610
Connor Williams: Usyk, and then step into a ring and think you're gonna enter a competition.


381
00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:25.110
Connor Williams: You're gonna get knocked out very, very quickly. So, as well as learning these skills, we need to practice them in a safe environment where we can make mistakes, we can learn, and then we go into the real environment, like you would in boxing. You do light sparring, heavy sparring, and that's what we do here.


382
00:37:25.210 --> 00:37:34.310
Connor Williams: We run mock calls, we do sales exercises, we give you the practice to piece this stuff together, so you're actually confident in closing before you're let out into the industry.


383
00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:37.449
Connor Williams: So, when you are at that level.


384
00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:53.580
Connor Williams: we're here to actually get into a solid offer, and the reason that we guarantee this in writing is because, and touch wood, we've never had anyone who's not been able to be placed after they've done this, but it's because we teach you all the skills here properly. Now, what I will say.


385
00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:58.959
Connor Williams: Most people, they're placed in my network. So, we have offers you can apply straight into.


386
00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:13.660
Connor Williams: So these are warm offers, people come to us because we know, they know we train very high-quality sales reps, so we've got a very strong network of offers you can apply straight into and get placed with. But, if you are not positioned in the right way.


387
00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:23.580
Connor Williams: they're not gonna place you. If you don't know how to come across in the right way, they're not gonna place you. So this is why we go through so much training. But we even teach you how to find offers yourself.


388
00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:33.890
Connor Williams: We've had a lot of people just been able to find offers, reach out to them in the right way, get placed, so you can have a bit more selection over the type of offer you actually close for, especially if you want to work in the AI space, but…


389
00:38:34.090 --> 00:38:42.909
Connor Williams: We teach you everything the right way. We make sure that everything's done in the right way, and this is why we get the results we do. And, you know, you probably saw a little bit about our


390
00:38:43.070 --> 00:39:05.599
Connor Williams: like, students are successful, but if you look at the type of people that we help, Jay ran a string of barbershops. Hannah never worked in sales, but did a high-paying corporate job. Steve used to be a fast food restaurant owner. Shannon was in sales, Luke was in sales, yes, and we have a lot of great salespeople in here, but we've literally helped PTs, marketing assistants, stay-at-home mums.


391
00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:08.579
Connor Williams: Warehouse workers, accountants, so…


392
00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:28.130
Connor Williams: the experienced people come into this space is not the most important thing that I look for, and it's definitely not the most important thing whether they're going to be successful or not. Like I said, it's them. If they're willing to put in the consistency, if they're actually committed to hitting their goals, these are the things that make the difference. So, everything that we give them.


393
00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:36.220
Connor Williams: obviously puts them on that path, but half of that is down to themselves and making sure that they're ready to walk it. So, that's the Academy, man.


394
00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:39.850
Connor Williams: Love to go through any questions, or dive into that as deeply as you need to.


395
00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:46.889
Luke: Just a quick one, it's not really relevant, but would you say the market's saturated at the minute?


396
00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:59.569
Connor Williams: No, I think when you say saturated, it means that it's too competitive to have success. That's really what saturated means. But, you cannot ignore that this space is competitive, and it's getting more competitive.


397
00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:00.590
Connor Williams: the difference.


398
00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:01.360
Luke: Slowly.


399
00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:17.279
Connor Williams: Yeah, but if you look at an opportunity where you can realistically earn 10K in 6 to 12 months, why shouldn't people flood to that industry? It's the same as the agency space. I sold an agency program, because it's the same one I joined to help me with mine 6 years ago.


400
00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:27.650
Connor Williams: And they were doing that at the right time, starting to grow, first couple of years, great, but then free, year 3, 4, 5, and now they've got so much competition, but they still make over 100K a month.


401
00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:38.449
Connor Williams: You know, it's like e-comm. I've got, Joe, one of my best students, he's doing 26K a month. He works in an e-com offer, teaching people how to sell dropshipping businesses.


402
00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:57.349
Connor Williams: There's still gonna be a lot of offers out there. I mean, one of the most popular industries right now is coaching. It's people selling programs, so all of these businesses need closers. The difference is, like everything, though, like, I worked in the agency space for a long time, and the amount of people, well, I would say 70% of people that we had calls with


403
00:40:57.370 --> 00:41:03.640
Connor Williams: had tried the agency thing themselves, realized it was hard, and then came to us. So, you've got to realize that


404
00:41:03.730 --> 00:41:11.100
Connor Williams: Majority of people in this space are the type of people who don't want to invest in themselves, don't want to put the effort in, they want the quickest and the easiest route.


405
00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:20.689
Connor Williams: And they try and figure it out on YouTube, but as soon as you get an offer, even if you get an interview, and people ask you, well, what's your experience, and what training have you done, and you can't answer that question.


406
00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:26.440
Connor Williams: then you're not going to get very far. It's actually how most of my guys get placed without sales experience, because


407
00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:30.530
Connor Williams: Training will beat experience in this space most of the time.


408
00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:32.660
Luke: Right.


409
00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:48.889
Connor Williams: So, it's like all online spaces. You know, yes, it's gonna get competitive because it's a great opportunity, but if you're the one out of 100 who is actually willing to work hard and do what it takes, then, you know, this is how all of my guys get into the position that they want to.


410
00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:52.760
Luke: Spawn.


411
00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:53.679
Connor Williams: Any other questions?


412
00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:57.790
Luke: No, off the top of my head, no.


413
00:41:57.790 --> 00:42:16.340
Connor Williams: Cool. Well, now you've seen, you know, I've had my time, mate, vetting you, making sure that I think that you can make it in this space. So, the shoe's on the other foot now. Now we have been through it, you know, how do you feel about the program? Obviously, the question was, can we hit 10K by the end of this year? So, do you think if you went through this, that would be possible?


414
00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:19.500
Luke: Yeah, definitely. Definitely.


415
00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:22.870
Connor Williams: Cool. Well, I guess, last question is, are we ready to do this?


416
00:42:24.490 --> 00:42:25.330
Luke: I think so.


417
00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:38.269
Connor Williams: Cool. Well, look, I… like I said, what I respect is the… the 10 out of 10 commitment, there's no hesitation there. That's always something I look out for. The fact that you have tried other things, and, you know, we've spent our time looking


418
00:42:38.370 --> 00:42:52.710
Connor Williams: at the right thing, what we think we're gonna do well, and what we think is actually gonna give us the right opportunity. So, like I said, I'm 100% confident, man. So, talking about the investment side, the setup, so just for, you know, a breakdown.


419
00:42:52.900 --> 00:43:11.139
Connor Williams: With the full program, that is the mentorship with me, one-on-one, the guarantees, everything like that, that's the 5K. And we do have a 2K option of literally just the course only, and kind of doing it by yourself. But, based on the conversation, you know, the accountability aspects, I think the mentorship is really what's going to get you into a good position.


420
00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:29.050
Connor Williams: Now, what I also like to incentivize, again, it's that entrepreneurial urgency. I want to capitalize on people that do just want to get working straight away. So, if we can get started tonight, then I would be happy to give you a £1400 pound discount. So, rather than 5K, it would only be £3,600.


421
00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:31.110
Luke: Right.


422
00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:34.849
Luke: That's what Conn… like, Connor said, that they…


423
00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:43.679
Connor Williams: Yeah, he had to come back, though, because he was away for C for a little bit. So, yeah, he had to pay the full whack.


424
00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:45.610
Connor Williams: Yeah, I think…


425
00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:49.939
Luke: To be honest, as much as I'd love to, I'm gonna have to apply for a bank loan.


426
00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:54.090
Luke: And then, unfortunately, pay the full luck.


427
00:43:55.130 --> 00:44:02.720
Connor Williams: Okay, so, I mean, when we say we're gonna have to go away and get a bank loan, do we mean that we don't have that money right now?


428
00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:09.449
Luke: I do, but, so, me and my girlfriend, so we've just come back 6 months traveling.


429
00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:10.670
Connor Williams: Oh, nice.


430
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:20.530
Luke: Yeah, so we did Southeast Asia and stuff. I have the money there, but our house is under construction at the minute, so we've not…


431
00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:24.400
Luke: Got a house yet, but… We've had our mortgage offer.


432
00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:28.109
Luke: Etc, and that is… May time.


433
00:44:28.350 --> 00:44:28.870
Connor Williams: Yeah.


434
00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:36.590
Luke: So, the money that I do have and saved up is… Yeah, technically far.


435
00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:49.069
Connor Williams: Okay, well, I mean, in terms of the process, though, are we confident that we can get into this space, you know, relatively quickly, look at getting a role in 90 days, obviously start earning some income alongside that?


436
00:44:49.540 --> 00:44:50.349
Luke: Yeah, mate.


437
00:44:50.660 --> 00:44:56.750
Connor Williams: And the best option you think, is gonna have to be going away, getting a loan, and then paying the additional $1,400?


438
00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:58.190
Luke: I think so, yeah.


439
00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:00.900
Connor Williams: Well, look, I mean, at the end of the day.


440
00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:16.990
Connor Williams: if it is just a financial constraint, and you are still fully committed to making this work from your side, again, we're not going to get into the habit of maybe not doing as much work as we need to. It is literally a financial constraint. I mean, what if we could split that down over a few months?


441
00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:24.689
Connor Williams: So, rather than paying it all in one, we can pay it over 3 months. So that means we can still keep a 1400 discount.


442
00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:27.769
Connor Williams: And then, takes a little bit of financial burden off you.


443
00:45:28.390 --> 00:45:30.660
Luke: What, so how much would it be? Three points?


444
00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:33.050
Connor Williams: Free payments of 1.2.


445
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:39.959
Luke: I think, I think, honestly, I'm probably best, like, personally.


446
00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:43.180
Luke: Getting… getting, a bank loan.


447
00:45:43.800 --> 00:45:50.850
Connor Williams: Okay, but if you can split that down, say $1,400, and then still get the bank loan, how's that gonna be different?


448
00:45:51.550 --> 00:45:52.340
Luke: What'd you mean?


449
00:45:52.520 --> 00:46:02.049
Connor Williams: Well, if you paid the £1200 now to get started, it would give you whatever time you need to get any loans in place, and you'd be able to get a loan that was £1400 cheaper.


450
00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:04.769
Luke: Yeah, that's true.


451
00:46:05.150 --> 00:46:05.840
Luke: Book.


452
00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:08.570
Luke: I think what I'm… what I'm just trying to say is…


453
00:46:09.180 --> 00:46:13.610
Luke: I don't have the money at the minute to pay it, hence why I needed to get the bank loan.


454
00:46:14.050 --> 00:46:19.079
Connor Williams: Okay. Well, sorry, a moment ago you said you did have it, it's just, obviously, with the construction, and then…


455
00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:22.520
Luke: Yeah, yeah, so, so, so, I have, I have…


456
00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:29.790
Luke: money in my savings, but that's not to be touched, so currently, I don't have liquid


457
00:46:31.450 --> 00:46:37.159
Luke: savings that I can… I can spend myself on this course, so I'd have to go away.


458
00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:38.529
Luke: I could ask my dad.


459
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:44.450
Luke: If he could… lend me, and I could pay him back monthly.


460
00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:47.990
Luke: Over a longer period, or wait to get a bank loan.


461
00:46:49.630 --> 00:46:50.870
Luke: Oh, cause that's my mom.


462
00:46:51.110 --> 00:46:56.130
Luke: But… I am fully interested.


463
00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:59.509
Connor Williams: Yeah. Because, like I said, mate, at the end of the day, 1400 is a lot.


464
00:46:59.830 --> 00:47:04.370
Connor Williams: Especially if you're now saying that you have to really figure out some other financial means.


465
00:47:04.690 --> 00:47:05.560
Luke: Large time.


466
00:47:05.730 --> 00:47:13.040
Connor Williams: Yeah, coming back and expecting to pay 1400 more, that's the thing that doesn't make sense, but if there was an option that we could have to split it down, make it easier.


467
00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:19.709
Connor Williams: that looks like it's going to be the most sensible option. However, if we are still teetering at


468
00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:25.500
Connor Williams: Maybe I'm not so unsure about the finances, I'm more unsure about the process.


469
00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:38.149
Connor Williams: that would make more sense as to why we probably can't figure our way out now. So, if we were being 100% honest here, man, is it really the financial side, or is there something else that you feel like is potentially holding you back a little bit?


470
00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:39.730
Luke: It's not the process.


471
00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:42.279
Luke: It's not the process, it's the financial side.


472
00:47:42.690 --> 00:47:44.970
Luke: 100%, it's the financial side.


473
00:47:44.970 --> 00:47:45.470
Connor Williams: Okay.


474
00:47:45.470 --> 00:47:50.570
Luke: Because, in my situation, we've got this house, That's… that's…


475
00:47:50.830 --> 00:47:53.319
Luke: Under construction. We've got the deposit.


476
00:47:55.520 --> 00:48:03.690
Luke: It's a brand new house, so we've got stuff to pay for in the house, so I've got a car, so that the thousand pounds a month…


477
00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:10.000
Luke: After all my savings, I'm left with £1,000 in my… account.


478
00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.090
Connor Williams: Yeah. Effectively.


479
00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:16.000
Luke: So, I think the best option for me would be to get


480
00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:24.540
Luke: a bank loan, so it's smaller payments. I know it's £1400 more, but that's just more suited and tailored to my.


481
00:48:25.350 --> 00:48:27.690
Connor Williams: And how long are you hoping to pay that loan off of?


482
00:48:27.690 --> 00:48:30.870
Luke: I don't know, I haven't looked at it yet.


483
00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:31.850
Connor Williams: Okay.


484
00:48:32.210 --> 00:48:35.490
Connor Williams: So, yeah, I mean, 1400 is a lot at the end of the day.


485
00:48:35.490 --> 00:48:36.730
Luke: Yeah, I agree.


486
00:48:36.730 --> 00:48:40.290
Connor Williams: So, like I said, it's more for me, it's about the commitment of someone.


487
00:48:40.610 --> 00:48:41.190
Connor Williams: Because…


488
00:48:41.190 --> 00:48:41.510
Luke: Yeah.


489
00:48:41.510 --> 00:48:50.370
Connor Williams: doing this a long time, obviously. You know, the most common circumstances that there's a reason to not go ahead, and then it's more that that person is so scared to go ahead that…


490
00:48:50.470 --> 00:49:08.940
Connor Williams: they never do anything, and then they just lock themselves back into the same place that they've spent it now, telling me they don't want to be. So, if I can find an option that works for someone, I'll always explore it. So, if it really is down to, you know, finances are a bit of a problem, and us wanting to pay $1,400 more is the only option, again, if there's anything that we can do.


491
00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:14.380
Connor Williams: then I'll be more than happy to look at it. So, in some cases, we've even looked at leaving the deposit.


492
00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:24.620
Connor Williams: Securing our space, so at least we don't have to wait a month, worst case, if too many people come in, and then securing the discount, and then we work out a plan of, right, what does it actually look like to get started?


493
00:49:26.010 --> 00:49:29.220
Connor Williams: So… What if we look at an option like that, then?


494
00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:36.399
Connor Williams: So, what does the process look like in terms of securing additional funding as well?


495
00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:41.719
Luke: M… I'd more than likely have to get a bank loan.


496
00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:49.129
Connor Williams: Yeah. And do you have any idea, roughly, again, are you looking to do it over a year? Are you looking to do it over…


497
00:49:49.130 --> 00:49:51.160
Luke: It would probably be a couple, to be honest.


498
00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:53.090
Connor Williams: Yeah. Okay, well…


499
00:49:53.230 --> 00:50:08.029
Connor Williams: 24, yeah. So, yeah, it'll probably only be a couple hundred… well, a couple hundred pound a month then. Cool. So, do you have any loans and stuff at the moment? I know my bank is quite easy to get a loan, as long as I ain't got too many other things out at the moment.


500
00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:12.470
Luke: I haven't got any loans, obviously I've got… My car and stuff, so…


501
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.900
Connor Williams: Fathom.


502
00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:14.710
Luke: It's debt, but I haven't got any loans.


503
00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:18.719
Connor Williams: Okay, cool. So… Let's just have a look.


504
00:50:18.870 --> 00:50:26.570
Connor Williams: So, the deposit side of things, we only take £100, by the way. It's not, like, a big deposit. Again, it's just to hold out


505
00:50:26.930 --> 00:50:39.180
Connor Williams: while we get ourselves sorted, and then what I can do is I can at least get you in the system, again, get you space allocated out, save the discount out, and then we can book in a rough time to actually get started.


506
00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:40.860
Luke: Right.


507
00:50:41.390 --> 00:50:48.140
Connor Williams: So, getting your account and everything set up, what email address is the best to use?


508
00:50:49.130 --> 00:50:52.859
Luke: Lukelewis2002 at gmail.com.


509
00:50:53.730 --> 00:50:55.510
Connor Williams: Is that the one you booked a call with?


510
00:50:55.740 --> 00:50:56.460
Luke: Yeah.


511
00:50:57.390 --> 00:50:58.250
Connor Williams: Cool.


512
00:51:02.170 --> 00:51:09.589
Connor Williams: So, what I'm gonna do, mate, I'm gonna email you out a deposit link, It's just pay by card.


513
00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:15.720
Connor Williams: And then I'm going to get you in the system, get your account details set up.


514
00:51:16.020 --> 00:51:33.660
Connor Williams: So then, that's the discount and the place saved, and then we'll figure out a plan of action, when we can probably get started. So, like I say, knowing my banks, they don't really take too long. So, when do you feel like we're gonna anticipate catching up again?


515
00:51:34.830 --> 00:51:38.590
Luke: Have you got a WhatsApp number, or is email best?


516
00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:45.330
Connor Williams: I already WhatsApp'd you, didn't I, to check on the call? Shit, yeah, that's right. Yeah. It's a WhatsApp.


517
00:51:45.330 --> 00:51:49.499
Luke: Yeah, what day is it today? Tuesday?


518
00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:54.149
Luke: I'll… I can WhatsApp you bye.


519
00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:55.540
Luke: Friday.


520
00:51:56.010 --> 00:51:56.990
Luke: Hopefully.


521
00:51:57.110 --> 00:51:58.880
Connor Williams: Yeah. Cool.


522
00:51:59.510 --> 00:52:04.409
Connor Williams: So… There we go. Did you get the email for it as well?


523
00:52:04.850 --> 00:52:05.560
Luke: Pardon?


524
00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:07.470
Connor Williams: Just get your, the email through as well.


525
00:52:07.650 --> 00:52:08.939
Luke: Let me double check.


526
00:52:12.030 --> 00:52:13.010
Luke: Yeah, yeah.


527
00:52:13.330 --> 00:52:14.319
Connor Williams: There we go.


528
00:52:14.580 --> 00:52:23.279
Connor Williams: Yeah, cool. Yeah, alright, well, if you can take care of that deposit now, let me just get you an account and everything's set up.


529
00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:28.220
Connor Williams: And then, yeah, what we can do is we can catch up on Friday over WhatsApp.


530
00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:30.020
Luke: Right, no probes.


531
00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:34.430
Connor Williams: Where's… Your details, yeah.


532
00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:46.030
Connor Williams: And then… In terms of, like, the process of getting started as well.


533
00:52:46.290 --> 00:53:00.010
Connor Williams: It's nice and straightforward. I do like to leave a day between logging you in and doing, like, an onboarding call, because there's about an hour and a half of content you go through, where what we do is we basically set a roadmap from day one.


534
00:53:00.990 --> 00:53:12.749
Connor Williams: What do we… what do we need to focus on? What hours, like, where can we fit these hours in? Like, what is a goal that we're both going to agree we're going to get to in 6 months? All, you know, all that stuff. I want to have a rock-solid plan for you from day one that we follow.


535
00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:17.260
Luke: Right, no problem.


536
00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:21.530
Connor Williams: I guess the next question is, are you gonna catch up Connor as well?


537
00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:23.640
Luke: Yeah.


538
00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:27.049
Connor Williams: Haha! Well, he's, he's 5 weeks in.


539
00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:30.789
Connor Williams: And he's got a little bit more time, so, yeah.


540
00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:34.410
Luke: He's mental. He's mental. I'm gonna give him a call now, actually.

00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:57.680
Connor Williams: Cool. Let me just… There we go.


549
00:53:57.680 --> 00:53:58.660
Luke: My Wi-Fi.


550
00:53:59.150 --> 00:54:02.599
Connor Williams: There we go. Yeah, did you, do the deposit, mate?


551
00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:03.960
Luke: No shit, no.


552
00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:06.769
Connor Williams: I just need, yeah, I just need to get that through before I set you up, that's all.


553
00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:16.260
Connor Williams: And then I'm looking at my Friday, I've got a couple of bits in the morning, but we should be able to squeeze a call in.

Luke: What's that for?


558
00:54:54.210 --> 00:54:56.410
Connor Williams: It's just, like, for energy.


559
00:54:56.710 --> 00:54:57.610
Luke: Oh.


560
00:54:58.200 --> 00:55:07.839
Connor Williams: Yeah, try and take some kind of early evening, because, I have a couple of American days. I've got, a couple of calls now with, Central Time, so it's like 2 o'clock in the afternoon for them.


561
00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:09.020
Luke: Damn.


562
00:55:09.390 --> 00:55:15.360
