1
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.019
Cónal Donovan: Hey, Connor, how are you?


2
00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.179
Connor Williams: There we go. Hey, how's it going, bud? You all good?


3
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:31.629
Cónal Donovan: You wouldn't know yourself?


4
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:39.599
Connor Williams: Yeah, not too bad, mate, not too bad. Been, looking forward to going through. So, did you manage to see the videos and stuff before the call?


5
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:44.929
Cónal Donovan: Yeah, I saw a lot of the client testimonials, and was watching, I was reading through the FAQs.


6
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:45.360
Connor Williams: Death.


7
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.209
Cónal Donovan: I think that's, I've had a bit of homework done, I've…


8
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.800
Cónal Donovan: Been in contact with a few others, a few other,


9
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.689
Cónal Donovan: remote sales, kind of mentors, and things like that before. So I just had, kind of, a couple of questions.


10
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:03.820
Cónal Donovan: Based on what was said there, just said about the guarantee… said you're guaranteed a placement?


11
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:14.460
Connor Williams: Yeah, well, I mean, it's a guarantee, but there's obviously conditions of that, and the biggest one is, is that it's not like anyone can just come through, buy the course.


12
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:33.110
Connor Williams: don't get the results, they don't, you know, it is a mentorship with me, where, you know, and touch wood, I've never had anyone come through this program, apply what we've kind of taught them, do the step-by-step, and then not been able to get a role. And what I'll also say is, like, the conditions of that are very reasonable. I'll show you the exact terms.


13
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.579
Connor Williams: But for me, again, the reason that I've been able to have that sort of success rate is because


14
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:51.169
Connor Williams: I work with everyone one-on-one as a mentor. I want to make sure that they have got everything it takes to make it in this space, because yes, it's a lot easier than an online business, but it's certainly not easy.


15
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.290
Cónal Donovan: No, not.


16
00:01:52.290 --> 00:02:11.629
Connor Williams: do have to have, kind of, everything to make it as an entrepreneur, because look, what do we want? A life better than 99% of people, right? Like, more money, freedom, travel, all that good stuff. So that doesn't come without that kind of hard work. So yeah, man, it would be good to learn a bit more about yourself, you know, just make sure that we're in the right position to make this work.


17
00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:25.549
Connor Williams: If we do feel, you know, that's the case, then yeah, we'll go through all your questions, I'll show you what the process actually kind of looks like, and then, yeah, mate, if you absolutely love it, we could even get set up. But, you know, tell me, what's actually kind of brought you into this space, and then on with me?


18
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:37.160
Cónal Donovan: It's just something I've been really looking into for the last few years, even. As I spoke to you initially about, I was kind of interested in it a few years ago. And then when I got the other job as a sales rep.


19
00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:44.749
Cónal Donovan: I was working online from Dubai, so I was teaching during the day, and then doing two or three hours, and even of outreach, and…


20
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:56.209
Cónal Donovan: kind of business development, that type of stuff, getting contacted schools and things like that. Yeah. But, it was solar, solar energy, so… So, I just got comfortable doing that, and then I actually started working, I got home.


21
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.580
Cónal Donovan: I was like, oh, I have a job, I don't really need to…


22
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:07.060
Cónal Donovan: go much further with this. I was like, I have it… have it sussed out, I have a bit of side hustle going, but I wanted to be able to give it a go now full-time, because…


23
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.680
Cónal Donovan: I just don't see myself teaching anymore, and I want… a life where I can…


24
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:20.569
Cónal Donovan: So, if I know I have 8 hours of work to do a day, that I can get up, do my gym in the morning, do 3-4 hours of my own work that I'm interested in doing myself.


25
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.900
Connor Williams: Yeah.


26
00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:28.300
Cónal Donovan: Pardon me, stuck in school, correcting copies, do you know what I mean? So, and then take a break, and then do 3 or 4 hours again, whatever it takes to…


27
00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.099
Cónal Donovan: make people up, you know? Yeah. But.


28
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:37.369
Connor Williams: Yeah. No, that's what I loved about being a closer. You know, I obviously traveled quite a lot, when I was closing, so…


29
00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:56.910
Connor Williams: you know, the difference between Bali, or Canada, or Australia, the time zones are very different, so I'd like to… I'd usually like to have a bit of work in the morning, have the day to myself, you know, go surfing, or go to the gym, or do something, and then do a little bit more in the evening, so having that… having that ability for me was always, like, the biggest thing. But what do you feel like the biggest thing is missing, then?


30
00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.920
Connor Williams: Like, that you're not really getting out of the job.


31
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:02.400
Connor Williams: That you're in at the moment.


32
00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:12.659
Cónal Donovan: I suppose, as I said before, kind of financially, you'd like to be rewarded for the work you're doing. If you're being successful, if you're closing deals, you're obviously being rewarded that way. If you're working hard.


33
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.659
Cónal Donovan: We're getting awarded, whereas if I work… if I do 4 or 5 hours.


34
00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:21.499
Cónal Donovan: after work, there's no difference than if I do nothing special, you know, so…


35
00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.069
Cónal Donovan: My motivation's quite low at the moment to do anything.


36
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:29.750
Cónal Donovan: In teaching. Whereas, like, I know if I was jumping on a call, and I was like, right, at the end of this, if I do well.


37
00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.209
Cónal Donovan: If it suits the customer, if he gets the product, or the service.


38
00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.929
Cónal Donovan: I get rewarded for helping them solve that problem.


39
00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:50.159
Connor Williams: Yeah, I mean, I'm a military background, so I don't think you can get a worse environment for your… I can work the hardest, I can work the least, but I always get the same. And even, you know, it's blanket punishment. If one of us fucks up, everyone suffers, so…


40
00:04:50.200 --> 00:05:06.730
Connor Williams: I appreciate some bits of that, but yeah, like, later on in my life, you know, I definitely wanted to work harder and see more, and I knew that that was never a place to do it, and even in sales, I kind of saw the limitations there, but if financially, you know, that's a big driver for us, then.


41
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.299
Connor Williams: what would you say, you know, I mean, where's the level you actually want to get to, financially, then?


42
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:17.750
Cónal Donovan: Well, I wouldn't put a ceiling on it, but I would kind of set markers along the way, like, say, you obviously have your 10K,


43
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:24.979
Cónal Donovan: 15K, build it up, build it up. And obviously, it depends on the offer you're setting here with the high tickets and…


44
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:32.200
Cónal Donovan: there's kind of a plateau you can meet. You could be selling… doing really well, selling a low offer, or you could be doing 5 or 6 calls, selling a high offer.


45
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.419
Connor Williams: Yeah. So I understand that part, but…


46
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.369
Cónal Donovan: I'd be willing to put in the work to get…


47
00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.120
Cónal Donovan: To reach that tank… first 10K first.


48
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:51.130
Connor Williams: I think that's a, you know, it's usually a serious mark in this space, you know, when you can say you're doing 10K a month, people do treat you a lot more, seriously. So, yeah, you know, I don't ever want to…


49
00:05:51.200 --> 00:06:04.979
Connor Williams: set a 10K a month as a target for someone if it's just some frivolous, yeah, 10K. I do understand it's a notable thing, but, I mean, why 10K for you, though? Because obviously it does kind of mean different things for different people. I'm always curious, like, what is it?


50
00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.610
Cónal Donovan: That's obviously just the benchmark of…


51
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.509
Cónal Donovan: what I would kind of achieve… what I would deem as successful at the moment, like…


52
00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:13.110
Connor Williams: Yeah.


53
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.729
Cónal Donovan: I would imagine.


54
00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:14.929
Connor Williams: What does it give you, Don?


55
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:21.800
Cónal Donovan: I mean, all kinds of… like I said, there's no kind of financial worries, then you're… if you're going out for me, you're not looking at the check one.


56
00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:26.690
Cónal Donovan: have that safety, you're kind of saying, okay, I'm putting savings away.


57
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.120
Connor Williams: And I'm living a good life's that.


58
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:34.239
Connor Williams: Yeah, alright, cool. So if we got to 10K, we feel like we'd… we'd start to actually feel a little bit more…


59
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.120
Connor Williams: satisfied, necessarily.


60
00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:43.940
Cónal Donovan: Yeah, but I know, I know that, obviously, I've been playing sports and things like that, and obviously to see the high rocks thing behind you, like, you know, when you get a certain time.


61
00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.599
Cónal Donovan: Like, that helps you get an under and under and under, and that's…


62
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.169
Cónal Donovan: That's the good, that's the competitive nature, I suppose.


63
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:56.790
Connor Williams: Yeah, I was 116, 118 when I was doing it, and I was like, I ain't happy with that at all.


64
00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:57.550
Cónal Donovan: Oh my god.


65
00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:58.680
Connor Williams: Like, I'm the…


66
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:04.210
Connor Williams: I'm looking at one of these top 100 spots this year, and I'm thinking, oh, these fuckers are doing, like, 103 now.


67
00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:16.950
Connor Williams: Yeah, but mate, that's good, you know, it is… it was always important to kind of strive and achieve more, but like I said, it is… it is getting to a place better than what 98% of people have, at least, so…


68
00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:31.129
Connor Williams: you know, if we take the goal of, like, you know, this kind of freedom, this 10K a month for all these things, how long have you actually wanted to have these things, and how far away? I mean, how much are you pulling at the moment? You said 3 to 6, so where are you kind of sitting at the end of the month?


69
00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:39.110
Cónal Donovan: Probably around… It includes my housing allowance, so that would be around… Around 5K. Pound.


70
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:40.939
Connor Williams: And is that the most money you've ever earned in a month?


71
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:45.319
Cónal Donovan: At the moment, yeah. Yeah. It's a thing of the teaching as well, it's…


72
00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:51.470
Cónal Donovan: small increments every year. Yeah. Whereas when I started, I was here, and then my buddy two accountants are here.


73
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:54.329
Connor Williams: They've shut up, and I've kind of just got to put here, so…


74
00:07:54.330 --> 00:08:02.180
Cónal Donovan: Oh, it's just scale… scale that they can… they can improve their… their payment at, which I think is kind of the most I've been at at the moment.


75
00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:08.149
Connor Williams: So how long have you wanted to do this next step? Like, put yourself in this higher bracket of 10K, all these things?


76
00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:20.660
Cónal Donovan: I guess it was… I've been thinking about it since about 2 years ago, but then I kind of put it in the back burners again. As I was saying to you, I was having a good lifestyle, I was enjoying my holidays, all that, I was just back into routine of…


77
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:21.330
Connor Williams: Yeah.


78
00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:25.290
Cónal Donovan: this when I'm on, this when I'm off, and just happy and secure, whereas now I just kind of feel like…


79
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:26.910
Cónal Donovan: It's time to push it, like…


80
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:44.709
Connor Williams: Yeah, because, I mean, that's a big thing. Two years is a very long time, and, you know, I've helped some people to hit that 10K when they've wanted it, within, like, maybe a 7-month period. You know, they've wanted it in a month, they've started the journey in about a month's time, and then it's taken them about six months, but…


81
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:48.179
Cónal Donovan: the type of person I see getting to those points.


82
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:58.829
Connor Williams: the journey's always shorter for them, again, because it's kind of like that speed of action. Where I see more people struggle is the people that have kind of said, well, I've been looking into this for…


83
00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:08.959
Connor Williams: about 6 months, a year, even 2 years, and they still haven't done anything concrete about doing it, so… what's the difference now? I mean, like, 2 years is a long time, so, like.


84
00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:09.610
Cónal Donovan: What?


85
00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:11.369
Connor Williams: What really is the difference now?


86
00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:22.409
Cónal Donovan: Well, I've… I've kind of… I've given him my notice, I'm not going back teaching anymore. So June is the end of my contract, so I know that I have July and August, I get paid 2 months' salary, and I get a bonus.


87
00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:29.329
Cónal Donovan: So that's 3 months of… kind of a nest egg that can attack something and go all in.


88
00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:35.309
Connor Williams: Yeah. Let's just uncover that timeline, then. So, you've handed your notice in now.


89
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:36.220
Cónal Donovan: Yeah.


90
00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:37.040
Connor Williams: And when do you leave?


91
00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:37.380
Cónal Donovan: June.


92
00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:38.480
Connor Williams: June.


93
00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.909
Cónal Donovan: Yeah, end of June.


94
00:09:39.910 --> 00:09:41.449
Connor Williams: Like, how long is that?


95
00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:44.910
Cónal Donovan: Oh, yeah, that's terrible. So then, we have to…


96
00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:48.269
Cónal Donovan: I have 6 months where I can… Even during the day, I've…


97
00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:50.210
Cónal Donovan: Pre-class, and it's not really that…


98
00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:50.740
Connor Williams: Yeah.


99
00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.880
Cónal Donovan: I wouldn't have that much to do, so I can… I know I could. Cool.


100
00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:58.089
Cónal Donovan: work on this during the school day, and I'd have time after to work as well.


101
00:09:58.330 --> 00:10:05.480
Connor Williams: So I want… I don't want 5 months to go by where I haven't improved. Yeah. I want 5 months where I can build and then replace that wage with…


102
00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:12.180
Connor Williams: Yeah, I mean, the, the, obviously the guaranteed path that we have, the typical timeline is 90 days to get placed.


103
00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:22.759
Connor Williams: And then most people need to be doing it for a month, maybe two months, before they feel comfortable enough to jump in full-time. I think the longest guy I've had in… I actually posted about him last night.


104
00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:32.409
Connor Williams: Because he's hit 10K… well, I say 10K, 7.5 in pounds, which is 10K in dollars, and he's still working. The only reason he's doing that is because in March he's got a mortgage renewal.


105
00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:42.650
Connor Williams: And obviously, if you go self-employed fully, you've got to wait a year in the UK, so… he's my longest because of a bit of a reason like that, but… Alright, well, if timelines align quite well, then…


106
00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:47.229
Connor Williams: What do you think, like, the biggest… biggest…


107
00:10:47.690 --> 00:11:00.379
Connor Williams: Yeah, roadblock is gonna be for yourself to get to that point. I mean, do you feel comfortable right now that I'd be able to hit, like, well, probably not 10K by 5 months, you know, I don't wanna… there's no dream selling here, but…


108
00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:06.799
Connor Williams: at least to the position where you've replaced that 5K a month, and then you're doing this full-time by 5-6 months.


109
00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:13.920
Cónal Donovan: across the week, so obviously, obviously, the time during the day, which might be different hours as well, so I'd be able to take calls from


110
00:11:14.310 --> 00:11:18.029
Cónal Donovan: I imagine the UK, and… I'm 4 hours ahead of the UK.


111
00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:18.420
Connor Williams: Yeah.


112
00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:23.650
Cónal Donovan: I'm in… I'm… What's the way, what, 8 hours ahead of the US and Australia?


113
00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:24.490
Connor Williams: Yep.


114
00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:30.780
Cónal Donovan: Is that right? I'm copyright. Yeah, some of my guys in Dubai do Australia, because that works really well, some of them do UK.


115
00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:37.049
Connor Williams: America tends to be a little bit more tricky, just because, yeah, you are, like, 10 hours away.


116
00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.399
Cónal Donovan: Yeah, my friends said in Florence here, they work 12 to 8.


117
00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:44.080
Cónal Donovan: So that's… Yes.


118
00:11:45.010 --> 00:11:49.649
Cónal Donovan: Yeah, I think it's 8 hours from… yeah. When I don't… I'd be able to work in the evenings, taking calls.


119
00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:51.850
Connor Williams: On that side of it? Yeah. That's just the…


120
00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:55.770
Cónal Donovan: then, obviously, when the 6 months is over, I'd have my full schedule to…


121
00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.939
Cónal Donovan: Take on as much as I possibly could.


122
00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:07.479
Connor Williams: Yeah. So, yeah, what's the biggest thing that we need to get to that point, then? You know, I'm assuming, like, us talking, and you saying you've done some other, like, calls with other coaches.


123
00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.010
Cónal Donovan: Yeah, yeah.


124
00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:13.739
Connor Williams: There needs to be some guidance there somewhere, so what do you feel like the main thing is you need help with to get to that point?


125
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:17.580
Cónal Donovan: I suppose working on, as you said, like, the…


126
00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:21.219
Cónal Donovan: The calls, role-playing, obviously working on the sales technique.


127
00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:21.730
Connor Williams: Yeah.


128
00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:27.040
Cónal Donovan: I'm very bad for jumping in, and when you're speaking, I need to hold back, I can see it, I know myself.


129
00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:33.319
Cónal Donovan: But I've obviously been studying it for a long time, so I kind of understand the psychology of it.


130
00:12:33.850 --> 00:12:39.489
Cónal Donovan: watching other videos, but I just need to put that into practice, that's one thing. Cool. What time would your calls be at the…


131
00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:42.170
Cónal Donovan: The role play and all that.


132
00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:56.389
Connor Williams: So, when it's one-on-one with me, my students book it in directly, so it's always flexible. Like I said, I've got some guys in Dubai, so we usually do, yeah, it works well, because they finish work and it's still kind of, like, 3-4 for me.


133
00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:56.840
Cónal Donovan: Hmm.


134
00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:00.370
Connor Williams: calls. We have some group calls at, like, 2 in the afternoon.


135
00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:09.190
Connor Williams: Which would be 4, no, 6 in the evening for yourself, and we have some that start around 5-6, so probably about, like, 9-ish.


136
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:09.750
Cónal Donovan: Layer.


137
00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:28.979
Connor Williams: So, group calls we have there as well, and obviously you do student, role plays with me, role plays with other students, so, yeah, like, the roleplay side is flexible, but yeah, sales skills, definitely, you know, I've had so many people with years of sales experience, and even they really need to dive into the sales. What about actually landing a role as well? Like, actually getting… is that…


138
00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.759
Cónal Donovan: That's a… that's a big thing, so that's a huge thing I need help with, because…


139
00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.059
Connor Williams: Obviously, you're here.


140
00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:36.019
Cónal Donovan: You know, you reach out to…


141
00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:40.699
Cónal Donovan: Look on Instagram, reach out to these people. Just guidance on how to approach them, and…


142
00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:48.830
Cónal Donovan: obviously, what I've learned before is taking videos and be different, and make yourself stand out, and all this is just more, I suppose.


143
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.820
Cónal Donovan: Fine-tuning that and adding a bit more guidance.


144
00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:58.070
Connor Williams: Well, the thing is, is, you know, I've been lucky because I've seen this from every angle. You know, when I got a role 6 years ago.


145
00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:09.829
Connor Williams: I beat, like, 650 people in the application process. I was the one who got that role. You know, building my own team, building other people's team, I consult quite a lot in this space, which gives me a good network to connect guys with.


146
00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:10.230
Cónal Donovan: Yeah.


147
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:23.220
Connor Williams: roles, but I've, you know, I know what these people want to see, and it's not applying for a 9-to-5 job, and there's some things that people get wrong all the time, but if you do these things right, it's not hard to separate yourself.


148
00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:33.079
Connor Williams: So, I mean, from a logical side then, I mean, I'm not worried at all about those two things. You know, the only concern I have is when I get on a Zoom call with someone and they're a bit shy. You know, you can tell they're.


149
00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.420
Connor Williams: uncomfortable, which I don't get for yourself.


150
00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.550
Cónal Donovan: So…


151
00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:38.239
Connor Williams: I guess the other thing is…


152
00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:49.100
Connor Williams: You said you've done some other calls with some other coaches, so… what was the biggest reason one of them didn't, like, grab your attention and go, right, yeah, happy with this, I'm diving straight in?


153
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:54.530
Cónal Donovan: I suppose when I do get it, I want to make sure that it's the right fit. Like, I would have done…


154
00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:56.480
Connor Williams: One's based in Australia.


155
00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.860
Cónal Donovan: Obviously, the time zone for…


156
00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:02.959
Cónal Donovan: their role-playing calls are right in the middle of my working day, which I just…


157
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.349
Cónal Donovan: I can't get off at 12 o'clock, so that was kind of a thing for that.


158
00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:12.629
Cónal Donovan: And I was just doing my research and kind of price… price range, and seeing what… I know one of my other buddies is doing,


159
00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.569
Cónal Donovan: A course in social media measurement.


160
00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:16.360
Connor Williams: Yeah.


161
00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:20.779
Cónal Donovan: Obviously, there's kind of different price ranges between different courses. I was just kind of doing my homework, and…


162
00:15:20.950 --> 00:15:22.490
Cónal Donovan: Not biting at the burst.


163
00:15:22.690 --> 00:15:23.710
Cónal Donovan: First call.


164
00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:28.920
Connor Williams: Yeah, but do you think that… It's…


165
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:43.090
Connor Williams: And a bit of analysis paralysis, or do you think it is really about feeling the right? Because what I've found a lot of the time is that, you know, I've come from this space, and I did this for my first kind of mentorship when I was looking at social media courses, for my agency.


166
00:15:43.530 --> 00:15:53.919
Connor Williams: I would look at, like, 5, 10, 5, 6 people who, you know, what does this guy have, what does that guy have? And I just kind of realize I'm not really doing anything, because I'm overwhelming myself a little bit. It's like… it's like a relationship.


167
00:15:54.510 --> 00:15:56.429
Connor Williams: And so, you know, if you…


168
00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:00.030
Connor Williams: Are getting to know someone, but you're also texting 6 other people.


169
00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:07.379
Connor Williams: Is that thing gonna go right? So sometimes, yeah, it is, but sometimes you do find that right person, and you think, right.


170
00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:17.390
Connor Williams: I do feel that this is the best. So, for yourself, what is going to be that thing, do you think? Because, you're right, you should pick the person who fits you the most, but what is that thing for you, do you think?


171
00:16:17.910 --> 00:16:23.190
Cónal Donovan: I suppose, well, based on my last one that I've done, last night, I don't know if you've heard of it, ABC Academy?


172
00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:24.530
Connor Williams: Not that one, though.


173
00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:36.780
Cónal Donovan: Well, when I would have told the last place, or the last, kind of, meeting I had with somebody, they're like, oh, that one hasn't got a great name, but it's all, kind of, fed back in, it's all selling their own course.


174
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:40.799
Connor Williams: ABC is not a good name, like, I…


175
00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.770
Cónal Donovan: That's it, that's it.


176
00:16:42.980 --> 00:16:46.740
Cónal Donovan: You know what I'm saying? So just kind of making sure I had credibility, or kind of…


177
00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:47.490
Connor Williams: Yeah.


178
00:16:47.490 --> 00:16:51.650
Cónal Donovan: No, I wasn't going for a scam that… I wasn't something that's too good to be true.


179
00:16:51.910 --> 00:17:09.549
Connor Williams: Yeah, you know, it's hard sometimes, because in this space, I even talk to quite a few people who run similar offers. I've even had a couple of my guys who've come through the program hit 20, 30K months, and now they teach other people as well. And I think the space is so big, you know, you don't need to fight over it.


180
00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:18.140
Connor Williams: But, yeah, there's unfortunately a few people who have been in sales for, like, less than a year, and now, you know, they tell people they can get them to 10K in a couple of months, and it does.


181
00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:18.569
Cónal Donovan: Yeah.


182
00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:23.019
Connor Williams: down the credibility of the space. You know, I've been in sales, like, 12 years now, so…


183
00:17:23.289 --> 00:17:26.359
Connor Williams: I've seen it all, but yeah, I know what you mean, mate. But it is…


184
00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:30.619
Cónal Donovan: It's not, like, it's not… it's not all on the mentor either, it's a lot, like, 90% of it is…


185
00:17:30.859 --> 00:17:32.149
Cónal Donovan: The work you're doing yourself, so…


186
00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:34.219
Connor Williams: It's a 50-50 partnership.


187
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:37.050
Cónal Donovan: You know, it is 50-50, because…


188
00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:43.040
Connor Williams: Half of it is about you showing up and putting the effort in, the other half is making sure that what you're putting your effort into…


189
00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:47.639
Connor Williams: is going to be the right thing. So, you know, I guess if…


190
00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:54.830
Connor Williams: we were gonna put a goal of, you know, I would be happy to set a goal of, kind of, 5K to 7K by the end of 6 months.


191
00:17:54.990 --> 00:18:01.500
Connor Williams: I don't think, you know, if you're not coming into this with loads of sales experience, time as well is going to be a big one.


192
00:18:01.690 --> 00:18:16.929
Connor Williams: I don't think 10K would be impossible, but certainly, you know, I wouldn't want to send that as the benchmark. But if there was a path that we saw that, you know, you were confident that could get you to the 10K a month, I guess, like we just said, it's 50-50, so from your side.


193
00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:26.599
Connor Williams: if you… I mean, maybe give me a number, like, out of 10. Where would you say you are in terms of, right, I am X amount committed, or this is that X amount of seriousness for me to hit?


194
00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:31.790
Cónal Donovan: you know, 6K in the next 6 months as a closer. Or, like… Like…


195
00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:36.480
Cónal Donovan: The reason it's an 8 or a 9 is because of, obviously, the time that I can't…


196
00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.070
Connor Williams: Yeah.


197
00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:39.850
Cónal Donovan: that time during the day, that block where I have to do.


198
00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:50.740
Connor Williams: Yeah, well, I mean, look, your level of commitment with something isn't, like, other commitments, because when I was in a day job.


199
00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:54.189
Connor Williams: I was 100% committed to leaving that job.


200
00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:55.220
Cónal Donovan: Yeah, yeah, that's…


201
00:18:55.220 --> 00:19:02.200
Connor Williams: But for me, it's not like I… don't get me wrong, I actually got fired from 4 jobs, because I was pursuing online business and other things, and they didn't like it, but…


202
00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:11.189
Connor Williams: For me, it wasn't like I would quit my job and then was like, right, I'm all in. And also, the first thing I tried dropshipping, it took me 2 years and 20 grand, I lost.


203
00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:11.929
Cónal Donovan: That's out of it, yeah.


204
00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:28.520
Connor Williams: You know what I mean? Like, 10 grand in trading, 6 months of that gone. Had to take a little bit of time out. Then I tried the agency, which got me out, but it didn't scale because it weren't really for me. The closing was the only thing that got me there, but 5 years it took me to get out of a day job and 10K a month. That is commitment.


205
00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:35.149
Connor Williams: Because it's not easy to pick yourself off the floor when you've got nothing but evidence that you cannot make it, so…


206
00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:44.769
Connor Williams: like I said, I won't expect anyone to quit their job, like, when they join me, but what I do expect is 100% commitment, because like I said, it's 50-50, and if I'm giving 100%, I need to hear it back, so…


207
00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:59.219
Connor Williams: you've got a great timeline in place, you sound like you've got the ability to work around it, and just to maybe give you a bit more logistics, what I ask for for people is 15 hours a week. So 1-5, 15 hours a week, evenings, weekends, wherever that can fit in.


208
00:19:59.220 --> 00:19:59.880
Cónal Donovan: Absolutely.


209
00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:05.349
Connor Williams: So, are we still 8 or 9, or are we… Almost. Well, like, absolutely, time-wise…


210
00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:08.580
Cónal Donovan: Like, you'll always make time for things that are a priority, so…


211
00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:09.040
Connor Williams: Yeah.


212
00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:09.590
Cónal Donovan: Several.


213
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:11.039
Connor Williams: Compass up to 100%?


214
00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:12.659
Cónal Donovan: Oh, yeah, yeah, absolutely, yeah, yeah.


215
00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:13.380
Connor Williams: Awesome.


216
00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:26.009
Connor Williams: Well, look, I mean, if that's the case, mate, like I said, that's what I need from people. You know, I've helped, as you saw from the successful, literally, like, housewives and warehouse workers and accountants, which are, like, anti-sales people.


217
00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:41.809
Connor Williams: So, the experience isn't a thing for me, it is the person, and if you are going to be able to give this 100%, if you think you can do the 15 hours, the only other thing is, yeah, financially, just to give you an idea. So, if I build a guaranteed path for someone to get into that, like, within the next 6 months…


218
00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:47.500
Connor Williams: It really depends on what they need, how much one-on-one with me, or how much group, or whatever that kind of looks like, but in pounds.


219
00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:53.890
Connor Williams: it will range anywhere from 2K to $5K, depending on, obviously, what you would need. So…


220
00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:04.180
Connor Williams: If you did see this, and you were like, I am 100% confident this is gonna work, I guess the other thing is, is that something that we feel like we can do, or we're willing to put into a journey like this to reach that point?


221
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:06.250
Cónal Donovan: Oh yeah, yeah.


222
00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:09.800
Connor Williams: Cool. Well, look, I mean, I've obviously spent my time


223
00:21:09.890 --> 00:21:27.889
Connor Williams: just learning about yourself, making sure from my side, this is something we can give you. So yeah, the shoe's gonna be on the other foot now, mate. It's your time to kind of go through questions, all like that, but what I'll do is I'll share my screen, and I'll take you through the process. I'll show you what it all kind of looks like, and then we'll go through all of your questions. So let me know when you can see my screen, bud.


224
00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:31.209
Connor Williams: And then… we'll go through.


225
00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:36.380
Cónal Donovan: Yep, I see that, that's the… Academy.


226
00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:39.180
Connor Williams: Yeah, cool. So, have you been onto school before?


227
00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:39.959
Cónal Donovan: Yep, I have it.


228
00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:55.579
Connor Williams: Yeah, so you know the platform, it's got, you know, a course, it's got community, it's got all these good things in, but what I try and offer more here is mentorship, as opposed to just kind of like a course. So, what that looks like when you work with me.


229
00:21:55.750 --> 00:22:13.000
Connor Williams: I mean, the guarantee is to get you in a role in 90 days. So, that's where I want to spend time with you to make sure that that happens. But I built a workspace to kind of manage this journey on so that does happen, and what I do in here is I operate on two principles. Clarity and accountability. So when I say clarity, what I mean


230
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:31.320
Connor Williams: is that I give you this action list, this step-by-step of what to do, from literally the moment you join me, to learning the skills, to setting yourself up, to even closing in your first offer. And what you'll notice here is that there are one-on-one calls throughout this entire process. So, you book in with me.


231
00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:49.070
Connor Williams: directly, but let's say that you are in your first ever offer. Like, I don't even leave you alone when you're closing. Like, before you even take your first ever call, we book in a call together, we go through your scripts, we make sure you're ready. When you're taking calls, we do a call review to make sure you're improving your skills. So again, you've got that clarity and also that kind of support.


232
00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:55.299
Connor Williams: But, the big thing for me is accountability. So, what I have built here, and we do this for 12 weeks.


233
00:22:55.300 --> 00:23:09.220
Connor Williams: is, basically, we do an action plan every single week. We set, right, what coaching calls are we gonna jump on? What hours are we gonna put in? Like, I'm gonna set, like, clear targets for you to reach by the end of the week as well. But the most important thing


234
00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:22.319
Connor Williams: is that at the end of the week, you're gonna review that, and you're gonna tell me, not only, oh, I found this target, alright, like, did you hit that target, did you miss it, or did you exceed it? How was your energy? How much did you progress? How many hours did you put in? So…


235
00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:39.369
Connor Williams: I have this very honest reflection of how your week is going, so if you're telling me you're missing targets, we're gonna have a tough conversation. If you're telling me you're exceeding targets, I'm gonna push you even further. So, this is the level of accountability that I like to give people, and that's the only way I know how to actually get them in a good space. So.


236
00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:45.479
Connor Williams: that is how the mentorship side works, but in terms of the process, like I said, that kind of roadmap we build people.


237
00:23:45.550 --> 00:23:50.120
Connor Williams: It's carried out over 3 stages. So, over the 90 days.


238
00:23:50.320 --> 00:24:09.609
Connor Williams: We like to set you up in a couple of weeks, learn the sales in 6 weeks, and then secure your first ever position in the next 4 weeks. So, the reason we start in setup is kind of like we spoke about earlier. Standing out is the most important thing in this space, because if you can't do it, you're not going to get placed. Doesn't matter who you are, skill set, who your mentor is.


239
00:24:09.610 --> 00:24:13.910
Connor Williams: So, we position ourselves in the right way. As professionals.


240
00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.269
Connor Williams: If I could… if I got a pound for every time I had some…


241
00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:25.630
Connor Williams: teenage-looking moron, with candid photos of him in Ibiza, or looking out a window, going, yo, what's up, bro, you looking for a closer?


242
00:24:25.910 --> 00:24:28.760
Connor Williams: I wouldn't need to coach anymore, so…


243
00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:44.009
Connor Williams: it isn't about, you know, it's about having personality, yes, but it's also about professionalism and showing your value to the businesses you want to close for. So, positioning yourself, branding yourself, writing CVs, even paying yourself as an entrepreneur and setting a business up, we cover every single step.


244
00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:49.090
Connor Williams: So you are fully set up. And then, the big thing here is obviously sales. So.


245
00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:54.669
Connor Williams: Give me a number, 1 out of 10, because I always love a number. Where do you rate your sales skills at the moment?


246
00:24:57.630 --> 00:24:58.380
Cónal Donovan: Sticks.


247
00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:06.669
Connor Williams: Okay, 6, so probably confident speaker, good communicator, but not sharp, hard sales skills of closing and things like that.


248
00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:19.869
Cónal Donovan: Yes, I understand the… even if I could see, when you're talking to me today, I'm kind of seeing what I'm seeing the videos, when I get a question, then give the number out of 10, how they feel, what would it make to take it from 8 to 10?


249
00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:25.879
Cónal Donovan: you know, I understand the psychology and the approach to it, but it's just about nailing that approach.


250
00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:30.650
Connor Williams: I like having numbers, because they give me an objective view of where you think you're at, because…


251
00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:47.340
Connor Williams: You know, you can, like, when I ask similar questions, like, how serious are you about this? Someone will go, yeah, yeah, 100%, yeah, I'm so serious, and I'm like, alright, give me a number, and they're like, yeah, at least a 7, and I'm like, 7 is not serious! What are you talking about? So, yeah, again, just allows a little bit more…


252
00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:58.180
Connor Williams: insight into where people are actually at, but the main thing is that, you know, I teach something called New Age Sales, which is my own morphology of sales, and it's essentially just the opposite of old school.


253
00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:17.319
Connor Williams: What I don't want you to be in this industry is pushy, I don't want you to be aggressive, I don't want you to just try and bombard people with pitches and hope someone buys from you, because this space is about selling transformation. You know, you're gonna sell health, or wealth, or relationship offers that fix one of the keys to a happy life, so…


254
00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:29.869
Connor Williams: If you're not showing yourself as an authority who's there to guide someone into the right decision, if you can't understand the psychology on a deep level, you're not going to be able to sell in this space. So that's why we cover the skills, but practicalities, those hard skills.


255
00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:48.930
Connor Williams: it comes down to two things. How do you run sales calls, and how do you handle objections? So what I have built is a framework which allows you to run a sales call in a natural way, connect to someone in the right way also, but this is one I built from scratch, and I've done over 10,000 calls in this space. You know, I've personally closed millions, so…


256
00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:50.510
Connor Williams: All of my students.


257
00:26:50.670 --> 00:27:00.430
Connor Williams: learned this. I even have businesses that pay me to put this framework in theirs, so it has a better chance of converting calls into closes. So, I like to teach by breaking the theory down.


258
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:08.640
Connor Williams: Showing you in a live example, so you actually see me closing, there's about 25 of my calls in here. And then, we write that out together.


259
00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:24.870
Connor Williams: So you know how to actually run a call, and then obviously objection handling is going to come up most of the time. So we've got 3 whole modules on how to handle them, how to preempt them, so you can actually close at a very good percentage. Because if I can help your close rate to double, you've earned double the money by the same time.


260
00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:32.500
Connor Williams: So that's why I obsess about the skills here, but also, it's because, you know, 12 years in sales, and I've been a sales coach for the last 6 years, so…


261
00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:42.320
Connor Williams: I like to focus more on the skill set here, rather than just kind of, yeah, like, I don't want to be a hype man, I want to be… I want to be your coach, you know what I mean? So…


262
00:27:42.570 --> 00:27:52.900
Connor Williams: Once we've learned it, the practice is even more important, so yeah, like, we do role plays, we do sales exercises with me, with other students, so we make sure that you feel confident closing, and when you do.


263
00:27:53.530 --> 00:28:11.279
Connor Williams: Then, we get you into the remote sales position that you want. So, what that comes down to, and what I'll say first of all, actually, is that, look, we have a network. So, we've got a lot of offers in here that you apply straight into, and it's probably how most of my students get placed, but…


264
00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:26.620
Connor Williams: as we went through earlier, if you're not positioned in the right way, if you're not saying the right things, it doesn't matter. You're never going to get placed. So that's why we teach you how to get in front of these people, what they want to hear, how to come across, what to say in interviews, because it's not, again, it's not a 9-to-5 job.


265
00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:33.479
Connor Williams: But also, I like to show you how to find these things yourself as well. What I believe as, especially as a mentor.


266
00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:38.720
Connor Williams: As an entrepreneur, you do not want to rely on anyone for your success but yourself.


267
00:28:39.690 --> 00:28:45.019
Connor Williams: You shouldn't rely on me handing you positions, because what if one offer goes wrong? And what if I say, well.


268
00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:58.589
Connor Williams: oh, you know, I'll give you another one, but you owe me another 5 grand. You know, you shouldn't ever be relying on someone as an entrepreneur. You should always know how to go out, get these things yourself, fully support yourself, so that's why I do teach you these skills.


269
00:28:58.590 --> 00:29:07.019
Connor Williams: What I will say, though, is I don't charge you for another role. You get lifetime access to the network if you want to get another one. But, again, you should be self-sufficient, but that is…


270
00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:11.989
Connor Williams: the process. So, like I said, our 90-day timeline, our guarantee is that you


271
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:33.699
Connor Williams: go through setup in 2 weeks, which most people complete in a week, sales in 6 weeks, you get your role by the next 4 weeks. What we do is you apply for at least 5 positions in here, you reach out to at least 50 people using all the other methods as well, a week, and then that is our guaranteed process. Like I said, there's no terms that are impossible to reach. As long as you're doing your 15 hours, there's absolutely no way


272
00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:43.680
Connor Williams: that you won't get there. But on top of that, we do 4 group calls a week, so you'll be able to jump on with me, with other students. We've got an amazing community here of people, just like yourself.


273
00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:57.940
Connor Williams: So we can connect to, we can get feedback from, we can, you know, celebrate each other's wins. So, yes, I know Dom hitting his, 7.5 or 10K in the USD. So yeah, that is the Academy, man. So, plenty of time.


274
00:29:58.350 --> 00:29:58.820
Connor Williams: Oop.


275
00:29:58.820 --> 00:30:01.180
Cónal Donovan: We do usually get them starting in a…


276
00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:05.439
Cónal Donovan: Payment setting role, and then build onto the closer, or go straight for closing?


277
00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:22.120
Connor Williams: you can do appointment setting if you really want to, and what I'll say is in here. So, that's obviously the process, how we get you in a closing role, but what I do have in here is I have a sales library. I have a call library of loads of live sales calls of mine you can watch.


278
00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:25.659
Connor Williams: We have a sales library of additional lessons.


279
00:30:25.850 --> 00:30:33.760
Connor Williams: And within here, I have phone setting, I have DM setting, I have triaging, so I have a lot of additional training if you ever need it.


280
00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:38.230
Connor Williams: But, personally, I've always seen set in as a low leverage role.


281
00:30:38.910 --> 00:30:55.560
Connor Williams: You will have to work solidly 6 to 8 hours a day, and that's, like, constantly DMing people on the phone. You might get paid a base of about a grand in USD, but you only get 5% commission if someone closes. I don't know many sellers who make over, like, 2-3K a month.


282
00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:57.750
Connor Williams: So, you can if you want.


283
00:30:57.890 --> 00:31:04.460
Connor Williams: we do have people in here who do that, but I focus more on the closing, and I've never seen you need to go into setting before you get into closing.


284
00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:06.620
Cónal Donovan: Because other, other,


285
00:31:07.790 --> 00:31:13.339
Cónal Donovan: kind of course I would have looked at, or mentorships I would have looked at, to start you off in appointment setting.


286
00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:20.279
Cónal Donovan: So you're kind of learning on the job, and then you move on. But I personally prefer this avenue. With those…


287
00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:23.060
Cónal Donovan: Roles that you have in that network.


288
00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:25.569
Cónal Donovan: Almost, of the…


289
00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:32.639
Cónal Donovan: business? Are they mostly, like, business-to-business? Are they… in what field are they? Are they more so, kind of, like, personal…


290
00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:36.660
Cónal Donovan: kind of, like, improvement plans, as Jim kind of…


291
00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:46.260
Connor Williams: It's… I mean, it's mostly B2C, like, selling to consumers, but even in the B2B, technically, space, you know, my offer, for example, when I was a closer.


292
00:31:46.350 --> 00:32:04.989
Connor Williams: it was aspiring and struggling agency owners who want to scale up to 15K a month. So, I would deal with some people who had quit their day job 3 years ago, been running an agency for 3 years, sitting about 7K, wanted to obviously improve. I also speak to people who were in a day job, much like self, really wanted a path out, so…


293
00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:14.729
Connor Williams: technically, it kind of sits B2C, because the person who's buying it is a consumer of what you're selling, rather than a hierarchical business where you've got to speak to 15 different people.


294
00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:15.250
Cónal Donovan: red tape.


295
00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:29.250
Connor Williams: real estate sales, so we don't really do that. I think that's more corporate sales. So even when you're selling technically B2B, you are selling directly to the business owners. But, like I said, health-wealth relationship is what you gotta think. What one do you naturally gravitate towards?


296
00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:38.730
Cónal Donovan: Right, I'm obviously very interested in… like, even though I was looking at doing it, even trying to do it myself, or looking at seeing if I could do it myself, I was looking at what type of…


297
00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:44.909
Cónal Donovan: kind of, speciality I'd like to go into. And I was looking at… first thing I looked up was…


298
00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:47.680
Cónal Donovan: gym coaching. I don't think… like…


299
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:55.119
Cónal Donovan: One-to-one offers is the way to go, because obviously if you're getting 10% of the ticket, it's not exactly high ticket sale, it's…


300
00:32:55.460 --> 00:33:00.809
Cónal Donovan: 100 pounds, that kind of size difference, even gym business is scaling.


301
00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:03.059
Cónal Donovan: Going from, like, a gym ventilator.


302
00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:08.979
Connor Williams: I get a lot of people who work in a fitness offer, so it is one-on-one coaching, but they sell it for 3 to 6K.


303
00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:09.960
Cónal Donovan: Yeah, yeah.


304
00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:22.250
Connor Williams: So they sell 6 months at a time, 3 to 6K, some of them, you know, like I said, 6, 7K. But you will get, a lot in the health space, a lot of my guys are on health offers. So, yeah, we've got a lot of those ones.


305
00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:25.589
Cónal Donovan: Obviously, I wouldn't mind it once I got a start. I'd be happy, you know?


306
00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:26.390
Connor Williams: Yeah.


307
00:33:26.390 --> 00:33:31.009
Cónal Donovan: What would the breakdown of payment be? Have you got payment plans, or…


308
00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:33.299
Cónal Donovan: Is it one… one soft purchase?


309
00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:46.569
Connor Williams: Most of the time, it's one-off, but I've always, you know, been a bit more focused on people rather than money, so if someone really wants to start and they can't pay it all up front, you know, we always do explore a way that they can do it.


310
00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:50.540
Cónal Donovan: What way did the payments break down, then?


311
00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:54.980
Cónal Donovan: I know you're saying your availability, or kind of the amount of one-to-one, but…


312
00:33:54.980 --> 00:34:05.420
Connor Williams: Yeah, so, I mean, so usually if it's, like, more that I just need the information and the community, then people just come in, get lifetime access for 2K, and then the only thing they don't have is the one-on-one with me.


313
00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:15.690
Connor Williams: So it's just kind of like the course material, and the community, but if people want more coaching, like the group calls, the one-on-one, like, the guaranteed path, like, that is the 5K.


314
00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:31.759
Connor Williams: So, all the accountability, all that guarantee path, everything like that. But, I mean, the main thing, like I said, is the person. If I'm confident someone can come through, I do want this to be an absolute no-brainer. So, I mean, I do offer someone, if they're looking to get started straight away, £1400 off. So, rather than five.


315
00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:33.859
Connor Williams: That's brought down to $3,600.


316
00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:36.009
Cónal Donovan: Okay, yeah.


317
00:34:36.429 --> 00:34:38.859
Cónal Donovan: Yeah, it looks… sounds all good, that all sounds good.


318
00:34:38.989 --> 00:34:43.949
Cónal Donovan: Yeah, that sounds good. Would I be able to…


319
00:34:44.759 --> 00:34:48.239
Cónal Donovan: I know it is kind of a no-brainer, I'm very confident of that.


320
00:34:48.519 --> 00:34:55.509
Cónal Donovan: Would I be able to come back to you tomorrow and book that in? I'm gonna try and work my way around so I can pay it, not on the credit card, pay it off, and…


321
00:34:56.069 --> 00:34:59.740
Cónal Donovan: Straight away, and have it done. Yeah. Is that okay?


322
00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:04.099
Connor Williams: Yeah, yeah, no worries, man. Let me just check my diary.


323
00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:05.610
Cónal Donovan: Brooklyn another call tomorrow, maybe.


324
00:35:05.610 --> 00:35:10.580
Connor Williams: Yeah, yeah, let me just get my diary up. I've got a couple of catch-ups I'm doing with people tomorrow, anyway.


325
00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:12.770
Connor Williams: So, you're 4 hours ahead, aren't ya?


326
00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:14.760
Cónal Donovan: Yeah, I have.


327
00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:17.989
Cónal Donovan: a marathon… sorry, half marathon tomorrow at S.


328
00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:25.270
Cónal Donovan: 6 o'clock, 2 in the morning a few times, so that won't really matter, so… maybe around the same time again tomorrow? 3PM?


329
00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:29.450
Connor Williams: Yeah, what I can do… same email?


330
00:35:29.840 --> 00:35:31.049
Cónal Donovan: Yeah, same event.


331
00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:32.330
Connor Williams: Yeah? Sound.


332
00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:35.660
Cónal Donovan: I'm going to get the finances ready.


333
00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:38.520
Connor Williams: Let me, let me copy that over, mate.


334
00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:42.810
Connor Williams: Get that in. Any other questions and stuff you want to go through?


335
00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:47.859
Cónal Donovan: No, I was more than happy with that now. That's… it is the mentorship that I want as well, it's not the…


336
00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:51.610
Cónal Donovan: Of course, because it takes most of the accountability out of it, really.


337
00:35:51.840 --> 00:36:09.730
Connor Williams: Yeah, like I say, I don't… I'd only like to sell a course now, because I've had people buy it, and then they've… they've kind of dwindled off in the first month or so. So, you know, I want people here who are going to be able to focus on a path, and I can give them a kick up the ass when they need it sometimes. So, awesome, man. Well, look, I've,


338
00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:18.939
Connor Williams: Got that in… Tomorrow… So you should have an email come through.


339
00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:22.840
Cónal Donovan: And that's just… that's 3,600 pounds.


340
00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:23.400
Connor Williams: Yeah.


341
00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:38.920
Connor Williams: There, there we go.


342
00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:42.279
Cónal Donovan: Great, thank you very much, Connor.


343
00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:49.630
Connor Williams: No worries, man, enjoy your, yeah, Arx. Is, is Dubai weekend Saturday and Sunday now as well?


344
00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:55.269
Connor Williams: Yeah, when I was there, it was, what was it, like, Thursday was the weekend.


345
00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:56.520
Cónal Donovan: Yeah, probably Saturday.


346
00:36:56.520 --> 00:37:01.120
Connor Williams: Sunday to Thursday, rather than that. When did they change that? I had someone say this the other day.


347
00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:02.529
Cónal Donovan: I'd say 5 years.


348
00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:03.779
Cónal Donovan: I'll do that.


349
00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:09.409
Connor Williams: Yeah, I lived there in 2016, so… a while ago now, yeah, like, fucking a decade ago now.


350
00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:11.420
Cónal Donovan: What are we doing there?


351
00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:16.760
Connor Williams: I was living in JLT, so I was just a, yeah, just a property broker, working on the palm.


352
00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:18.130
Cónal Donovan: Oh, did you like that?


353
00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:25.350
Connor Williams: It was alright, I think it was a bit different, but my car… I found out my company weren't hiring me legally.


354
00:37:25.530 --> 00:37:37.029
Connor Williams: So, the working visas back then took, like, 3 months to come through, and the problem is you had so many people from the UK who said they want to be a Dubai property broker, but couldn't hack it because it was commission only.


355
00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:56.040
Connor Williams: So, yeah, I had some, rental deal go wrong, because the landlord was, funny about his paperwork, and then the woman kicked off, and then, I found out my company didn't hire me legally, and then they tried, like, pinning it on me, and I panicked, so I went home, and I was like, oh, do you know what, this is not worth it. But it was…


356
00:37:56.190 --> 00:38:10.359
Connor Williams: it was cowboy, like, my first company night out, there was 7 people hanging out of a branded Mini company car, pissed out of their face, driving down downtown, and I'm like, this place is worse than the UK.


357
00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:14.819
Connor Williams: And they were like, look, and the rule I got told was, white dish dash.


358
00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:22.129
Connor Williams: Red… red ring was Saudi, black ring is local, do whatever the fuck you want, but as soon as you see one of them, just calm down.


359
00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:34.350
Connor Williams: And I was like, okay. And they're like, keep 45,000 dirhams in your blood box, because if you get pulled over for drink driving, that's the bribe money that you pay the police. And I was like, Jesus Christ. Alright, fair enough.


360
00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:39.060
Cónal Donovan: Yeah, it's a tough game. The property's a tough game, especially the…


361
00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:44.519
Connor Williams: Commission-based only. Yeah, how do you find it? Are you hoping to stay out there for a long time?


362
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:48.019
Cónal Donovan: Or a year or two, yeah. I'd have to get something off and then have no…


363
00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:50.679
Cónal Donovan: No tax for a year or two, that'd be great.


364
00:38:50.680 --> 00:39:09.820
Connor Williams: Yeah, I've got a business partner, and we're doing a project where we're basically developing an AI sales coaching tool, so that'll help in here. So when you do roleplays and stuff, you can do it with the AI tool, get them reviewed, stuff like that. But he's out in Dubai, so we're gonna put the business through that, because I don't like paying 20% tax for VAT anymore.


365
00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:15.700
Cónal Donovan: So… Yeah, well, I'll have O'Connor, thank you very much for calling, and I'll be chatting tomorrow.


366
00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:18.909
Connor Williams: Yeah, legend. Alright, bud. Catch up tomorrow. See you later. Bye-bye.
