SALES PHILOSOPHY & PHASE SCORING FRAMEWORK

PART 1: EVALUATION FRAMEWORK (9 PILLARS)
The AI evaluates based on these 9 pillars across ALL phases:

1. AUTHORITY
Authority means the prospect believes: the rep understands my problem, knows how to solve it, will tell the truth, is qualified to lead this decision.
Built through: Positional (experience, results, case studies), Conversational (calm tone, clarity, conviction, controlled pacing), Structural (clear agenda, controlled transitions, decision guidance).
Evaluate: Built early? Maintained throughout? Transferred at decision moments? Weakened under pressure?

2. STRUCTURE
Prospect should feel "This person is leading me through something."
Includes: Clear intro, focused discovery, logical pitch transition, controlled close, defined next steps.
Weak structure = topic jumping, rushed pitch, confused close, prospect controlling flow.

3. COMMUNICATION & LISTENING
Strong: Listen deeply, pick up emotional cues, reference prospect's own words, use silence effectively, layered follow-ups.
Includes storytelling, analogies, framing, reframing, controlled pacing.
Assess: Did rep respond to what was said, or run a script? Miss emotional moments?

4. GAP CREATION
Create gaps between: current state vs desired state, current trajectory vs desired future, solo achievement vs supported achievement.
Strong: Stabilizes pain, increases ownership, quantifies cost of inaction, makes change necessary.
Weak: Surface-level pain, no emotional anchoring, early pitching, no consequence framing.

5. VALUE POSITIONING
Offer framed as: high relevance, logical solution, emotionally aligned, worth the cost.
Must be: anchored to pain, personalized, structured clearly, not feature-dumped.
Assess: Personalized? Value stabilized before price? Price feel expensive or inevitable?

6. TRUST BUILDING
Built through: clarity, calmness, truth-telling, not overselling, calling out misalignment.
Assess: Force the sale? Acknowledge concerns? Build credibility?

7. ADAPTABILITY
Adjust tone, pace, depth, energy, question style based on: prospect personality, difficulty, offer type, emotional intensity.
Evaluate: Did rep adapt or stay rigid/scripted?

8. OBJECTION STRATEGY
Strong: Pre-handle predictable objections, handle at belief level, maintain authority.
Belief-level: Identify root concern, reframe belief, anchor back to commitment.
Weak: Logical arguing, discounting, talking over prospect, becoming defensive.

9. DECISION LEADERSHIP
Prospect should feel "This is the right next step."
Strong: Assumptive language, clear investment framing, controlled silence, direct next-step clarity.
Weak: "What do you think?", asking permission to close, talking through silence, over-justifying price.

SCORING MUST REFLECT: Outcome, prospect difficulty, structural integrity, psychological control, authority consistency, emotional intelligence, decision momentum, adaptability.
A strong close against high-difficulty prospect may score higher than weak close against easy prospect.

PART 2: PHASE SCORING RUBRICS

═══ INTRO (Weight: 10% of Overall) ═══
Purpose: Warm call briefly, establish authority, frame call, set agenda, normalize purchase, transition to discovery.
Ideal length: 1.5–3 minutes. Maximum: 5 minutes.

Components to evaluate:
A. Controlled Icebreaker (1–2 rapport questions max, smooth, not dominating)
B. Context Calibration ("How much do you know about us?")
C. Frame/Authority Positioning (result statement, differentiator, subtle exclusivity, evaluator not chaser)
D. Agenda Setting (discovery first, pitch if appropriate, Q&A, normalize purchase today)
E. Tone & Delivery (conversational, calm, clear, controlled pace)

Scoring:
90–100 (Elite): 1.5–3min, smooth rapport, clean calibration, clear positioning, subtle authority, purchase normalized, no repetition, calm confident delivery, frames rest of call perfectly
75–89 (Strong): Structure present, slightly longer, minor repetition, authority slightly soft, agenda clear but less sharp
60–74 (Functional): Structure loose, too much/little rapport, weak frame, weak differentiation, slight rambling
40–59 (Weak): Over 5min or under 1min, no frame, no calibration, agenda unclear, overly friendly, repetitive
Below 40 (Damaging): Rambling, no structure, no authority, no agenda, prospect confusion visible

Score Caps:
- Intro >6 min without strategic reason → max 65
- Purchase never normalized → max 75
- Authority collapses visibly → max 60
- Agenda missing → max 55
- No frame at all → max 50

═══ DISCOVERY (Weight: 30% of Overall) ═══
Purpose: Understand prospect deeply, clarify position, identify problems, amplify pain, define desired state, build gap, surface roadblocks, pre-handle objections, qualify, build urgency.
Discovery is where the sale is won or lost.
Ideal: 20–25min. Good: 15–20min. Acceptable: 25–30min. Poor: <15min or >30min. Red flag: <10min.

Components:
A. Start With WHY (why they're on the call, what matters most)
B. Current Position (present situation, tangible metrics, current efforts)
C. Problems & Pain (identify, assess emotional impact, clarify consequences, quantify cost of inaction)
D. Desired State (specific goals, tangible outcomes, timeframes, emotional drivers)
E. Roadblocks (why haven't achieved goal, skill gaps, belief gaps, must align with offer)
F. Qualification (emotional: serious? committed? urgent? | logical: financial, partner, timing, capacity)

Adaptability: If "Aspiring" (escaping pain) → pain-led. If "Current" (wants next level) → roadblocks/growth barriers.
Authority: Challenge inconsistencies, call out contradictions, break limiting beliefs — without aggression.

Scoring:
90–100 (Elite): 20–25min, deep emotional clarity, strong gap, tangible desired state, roadblocks aligned to offer, urgency built, qualification done, authority maintained, adapted correctly
75–89 (Strong): Good structure, minor depth gaps, roadblocks identified but not leveraged, slightly rushed/long
60–74 (Surface-Level): Basic current state, vague goals, weak emotional anchoring, limited urgency, shallow qualification
40–59 (Weak): <15min or >30min uncontrolled, little depth, no gap, no urgency, qualification avoided
Below 40 (Damaging): <10min, no pain, no gap, no urgency, no qualification, rushed into pitch

Score Caps:
- Under 10 minutes → max 50
- No roadblocks identified → max 70
- No urgency built → max 75
- No qualification performed → max 70
- Chaotic flow → max 65

═══ PITCH (Weight: 20% of Overall) ═══
Purpose: Re-anchor gap, present solution clearly, connect to discovered pain, build trust, build inevitability.
NOT a feature list, data dump, script recital, hype monologue.
Ideal: 5–10min. Acceptable: up to 15min. Poor: <5min or >15min.

Components:
A. Big Outcome Overview (outcome-focused, tied to prospect's goals, not feature-focused)
B. Trust Builders (case studies, testimonials, data, social proof — relevant, not excessive)
C. Journey Structure (2–4 core pillars or milestone-based transformation, not random features)
D. UPS vs USP (Unique Problem Solvers, not Unique Selling Points — problem-led, each element solves a roadblock)
E. Personalization (references discovery, connects to specific pain, uses prospect's words)
F. Delivery & Energy (tonal variation, emphasis, pauses, conviction, authority maintained)

Scoring:
90–100 (Elite): 5–10min, outcome-led, clear structure, strong storytelling, fully personalized, UPS throughout, trust builders relevant, creates inevitability
75–89 (Strong): Good structure, some personalization, minor feature leakage, delivery slightly flat
60–74 (Functional): Loose structure, too many features, limited personalization, generic trust builders
40–59 (Weak): Feature-heavy, little structure, generic, no tie-back to discovery, monotone
Below 40 (Damaging): Feature dump, no structure, no personalization, no trust builders, confused narrative

Score Caps:
- No personalization → max 70
- Feature dumping dominates → max 65
- Over 15 minutes → max 60
- No trust builders → max 75
- Under 5 minutes → max 55

═══ CLOSE (Weight: 15% of Overall) ═══
Purpose: Confirm belief/value before price, lead to decision, present price as formality, maintain authority under pressure.

Components:
A. Invite Questions (buy-in check, give space, read "no questions" as resistance signal)
B. Value Confirmation MANDATORY BEFORE PRICE (anchor to goals, temperature checks 1–10, handle skepticism first)
C. Assumptive Commitment before price ("Sounds like we're ready to do this" — NOT "Would you like to?")
D. Handle "Price First" pressure (agree + acknowledge, reconfirm belief, then investment)
E. Price Delivery (clear, confident, no apology, pauses, no over-justification)
F. Incentive/Price Drop (if used: credible reason, no desperation, clean anchor-then-incentive)
G. Decision Leadership (calm authority, no chasing, confidence, direct guidance, clear next steps)

Scoring:
90–100 (Elite): Questions invited, value confirmed before price, anchored to goals, assumptive commitment, calm price delivery, silence control, credible incentive, strong leadership
75–89 (Strong): Correct structure mostly, slight softness, minor over-explaining, temperature checks weak
60–74 (Functional): Some structure, shallow value confirmation, prospect leads decision, too much talk after price
40–59 (Weak): Price too early, no value confirmation, permission language, apologetic delivery, poor silence
Below 40 (Damaging): No structure, no belief confirmation, chaotic negotiation, desperation discounting

Score Caps:
- Price before value confirmation (skepticism present) → max 70
- No commitment attempt before price → max 75
- Permission language dominates → max 65
- Discount with no credible reason / desperation → max 60
- Silence filled immediately after price → max 70

═══ OBJECTIONS (Weight: 25% of Overall) ═══
Purpose: Surface resistance, identify true root barrier, protect value, maintain authority, preserve momentum, lead back to decision.
Goal: Diagnose correctly, resolve cleanly, move forward decisively.

Two-Layer Model: Layer 1 = Surface Statement (what they say). Layer 2 = Root Barrier (what actually stops them).
Two Core Categories: Belief-Based (doesn't believe something) vs Logistical (physically cannot proceed).
Critical: Most "logistical" objections are actually belief-based. "I don't have the money" is often value misalignment.

4 Objection Types:
1. VALUE: "Transformation not worth investment." Signals: price resistance, cost justification, comparing alternatives. Handle: re-anchor goals, quantify cost of inaction, confirm belief. Wrong: immediate discount, defensive tone.
2. TRUST: "Not certain this will work." 4 layers: salesperson/company/offer/self trust. Signals: past failure, "what if", "how do I know". Handle: evidence, break limiting beliefs, clarify path, reframe failures.
3. FIT: Concept fit (right vehicle?) or Competitive fit (right provider?). Signals: comparing, "explore options". Must be pre-empted in discovery. Handle: clarify hesitation, reinforce alignment, position differentiation.
4. LOGISTICS: "Want this but physically cannot." True logistics require desire + belief confirmed, real barrier remains. Handle: clarify if real, explore realistic structure, maintain authority, no desperation discount.

Pre-Emption (50% of objection score):
Discovery: Financial position clarified? Partner authority? Urgency built? Commitment tested? Belief validated?
Pitch: Case studies used? Value stabilized? Differentiation clear? Fit reinforced?
If objections arise that should have been surfaced earlier → pre-emption failure.

Live Handling (50%): Diagnosis quality, emotional control, questioning depth, authority maintenance, commitment redirection.

Escalation Rule: If objections increase in intensity after handling → score reduction. If objection repeats → incomplete resolution → reduce score.
Margin Protection: Penalize early discounting, unnecessary payment plans, incentives without resistance, discounts before root clarification.

Scoring:
90–100 (Elite): Strong pre-emption, few unexpected objections, accurate diagnosis, calm authority, no unnecessary discounting, objections strengthen the sale
75–89 (Strong): Pre-emption mostly present, minor over-talking, slight misdiagnosis once, authority maintained
60–74 (Reactive): Pre-emption gaps, surface-level responses, slight defensiveness, discount slightly early
40–59 (Weak): Poor pre-emption, misdiagnosis, logical arguing, authority drops, early discounting
Below 40 (Damaging): No pre-emption, defensive, emotional reaction, heavy discounting, authority collapse

Score Caps:
- No financial qualification in discovery → max 75
- Partner authority not clarified → max 75
- Value confirmation skipped → max 70
- Discount before belief clarified → max 60
- Logical arguing dominates → max 60
- Authority collapses → max 55
- Objection repeats unresolved → max 65

PART 3: OVERALL SCORE CALCULATION

Formula: Overall = (Discovery × 0.30) + (Objections × 0.25) + (Pitch × 0.20) + (Close × 0.15) + (Intro × 0.10)

Overall Score Bands:
90–100 = Elite Execution
80–89 = Strong Professional
70–79 = Solid but Refinement Needed
60–69 = Inconsistent
50–59 = Weak Structural Control
Below 50 = Damaging Performance

Score is independent of outcome but interpreted alongside Prospect Difficulty.
Outcome does not automatically shift band.
