# Objection Handling Playbook

## Objection Type 1: I Need to Think About It

### Trigger Phrases to Detect
- "I still want to think about things"
- "Let me sleep on it"
- "Can I get back to you?"
- "I'm not ready to decide right now"
- "I didn't think I'd be signing up at this minute"

### Real Example
Matt says: "I still want to think about things a little bit. Sleep on it."
Context: Matt has analysis paralysis as a core life pattern. He acknowledged wanting change but defaults to delay.

### Handling Sequence

**Step 1: Pattern Interrupt**
Call out the contradiction between what they said during the call and what they are doing now.
"Isn't that just going against what we've been talking about the entire call?"

**Step 2: Identity Split**
Show them the gap between who they are now and who they want to become.
"There's two different people — where you are now and where you want to get to. Those two people would have a different decision-making process. To get to that next level, you've got to imagine yourself as the person that's already there."

**Step 3: Consequence Projection**
Show them what happens if the pattern repeats.
"Once again, the devil's going to win and next thing you know, it'll be six months later and you'll be on another call."

**Step 4: Risk Reversal**
Minimize the downside with the guarantee.
"There's the 90-day money-back guarantee. So worst case, you waste 90 days. In the grand scheme of things — 90 days versus wasted 5, 10, 20 years without trying something."

**Step 5: Decision Reframe**
Make the decision itself the transformation.
"The hardest part of change isn't the actual work itself — it's the decision you make as to whether you do the work or not."

### If They Still Resist
Acknowledge, offer to send payment link for when they are ready, but emphasize limited spots and mentor capacity. Do not leave it open-ended. Set a specific follow-up date.

## Objection Type 2: Now Is Not the Right Time

### Trigger Phrases to Detect
- "Maybe after the holidays"
- "Let me wait until next month"
- "I've got an event coming up"
- "Things are too busy right now"
- "Can I start in a few weeks or months?"
- "This would just be way overwhelming right now"

### Real Example
Jackie says: "I just don't think that right now the end of December is going to be it. My boy turns 21. We're going skiing."
Context: Jackie works 60-70 hours, has holiday plans, and stacks every possible reason to delay.

### Handling Sequence

**Step 1: Acknowledge Without Conceding**
Validate the event without accepting the delay.
"I would never say cancel your ski holiday."

**Step 2: Reframe Back to Core Pain**
Redirect to why they booked the call.
"The main reason you jumped on this call is not to be busier."

**Step 3: Urgency Question with Time Decay**
Make them confront the delay pattern.
"Is it better to do it now, or is it better to wait two, three, four, five, six months? Sometimes these things turn into years."

**Step 4: Minimize the Initial Commitment**
Reduce the perceived burden of starting.
"The onboarding call is like 15 minutes, and then you get the hour-long call later in the week."

**Step 5: Probe for the Real Objection**
Name the elephant in the room.
"I sense there might be something else, rather than time, because it would only be an hour of your time to begin with. Am I missing anything here?"

**Step 6: Lifestyle Mirror**
Expose the contradiction in their current life.
"You're on PTO right now and you're still waiting for a call about whether a truck made it. When are you going to claim your time back?"

### If They Still Resist
Schedule a specific follow-up call. Send your mobile and email. Leave them with one powerful reframe: "You've got to want to get your own time back and put yourself above other people." Do not leave it as "get back to me whenever."

## Objection Type 3: I Need to Talk to My Partner

### Trigger Phrases to Detect
- "I need to check with my husband or wife"
- "I'm not the one making the money"
- "I need to discuss finances with my partner"
- "My partner handles the budget"
- "Let me talk to them first"

### Real Example
Julie says: "I'm not the one making the money. So I'm trying to decide, do I go to Jared with this?"
Context: Julie is financially dependent on her husband. Asking him for money is tied to the core issue of giving away her power.

### Handling Sequence

**Step 1: Tie to Program Theme**
Connect the objection directly to their core problem.
"Would that be giving your power back to him, in a way?"

**Step 2: Empowerment Reframe**
Position the decision as the first act of transformation.
"This is about trusting yourself and being empowered to make decisions based on trust and moving forward — and that's where you are in this relationship."

**Step 3: Scale the Investment Against Time**
Put the cost in long-term perspective.
"4,900 in a scale of 40, 50 plus years is a drop in the ocean, would you agree?"

**Step 4: Frame the Purchase as the First Step**
Make buying the program the transformation itself.
"That way you've made your first step into empowerment. Taking action."

**Step 5: Offer Payment Plans to Reduce Friction**
Lower the barrier immediately.
"We can do two payments split in half — so you pay half now and the remaining in 30 days."

**Step 6: Book Next Micro Step Immediately**
Do not leave them to think alone.
"Let me book you into a quick 15-minute meet and greet with the coach. Then you'll know immediately you've made the right choice."

### Prevention Technique
Always ask the decision-maker check in Stage 1: "Will we need anybody else on this call before a decision can be made?"

## Objection Type 4: Is This a Scam

### Trigger Phrases to Detect
- "I'm a little skeptical"
- "Sounds too good to be true"
- "How do I know this is legit?"
- "I've seen a lot of scams"
- "Can you guarantee results?"
- "Other companies promised things and didn't deliver"
- "There's no guarantee behind it"

### Real Example
Jackie says: "I'm a little skeptical right now, not of you, but of the whole, you know. There's a lot of things that are like, oh, you know, do this, and you're going to make this much money."
Context: Jackie has been pitched by LinkedIn scammers and verified many through BBB as frauds.

### Handling Sequence

**Step 1: Validate the Skepticism**
Make their caution a strength, not a weakness.
"I'd much rather you were skeptical than not."

**Step 2: Set an Ethical Boundary**
Differentiate from scams with a clear rule.
"If anyone guarantees an income from any course, run a mile, because that's illegal, number one. The only thing we can guarantee is a system."

**Step 3: Show Do Not Tell**
Screen-share tangible proof during the call.
- Show real student channels like ToolZone with 50K subscribers
- Show actual Amazon affiliate link structure
- Show payment screenshots from real students into their bank accounts
- Show the backend portal with real income data

**Step 4: Anchor to Their Existing Skills**
Connect the proof to what they already know.
"You've already got a lot of construction knowledge. You already have industry knowledge in this space. That's why I brought this up."

**Step 5: Let Them Self Qualify**
Ask them to assess their own readiness.
"How confident are you that you could set up an Amazon affiliate link with recommendations of construction products?"

## Objection Type 5: I Cannot Afford It

### Trigger Phrases to Detect
- "That's a lot of money"
- "I don't have the funds right now"
- "My credit cards are maxed"
- "I need to save up first"
- "Can I do this later when I have more money?"
- "That'll hit the budget"

### Real Example
Matt mentions house renovation costs and limited savings. He says: "I need to put money into the house relatively soon. More than this."
Context: Matt has a legitimate competing expense but is also using it as justification to delay a decision.

### Handling Sequence

**Step 1: Reframe Money as Symptom**
Shift the frame from affordability to root cause.
"The money problem — is that the problem or is that the consequence of your problem?"

**Step 2: Two Types of People Frame**
Force them to self-select which type they want to be.
"There's two types of people. One says because of money, because of time, I was never able to achieve what I truly wanted. The other says despite money, despite time, I was willing to do whatever it took. Which one do you feel is more successful?"

**Step 3: Ask the Identity Question**
Make it about who they are choosing to be.
"Are you going to allow those things to stop you from getting what you truly want? Or are you going to allow them to give you more fire and drive?"

**Step 4: Investment Reframe**
Use the prospect's own words back at them if possible.
"You said earlier it's an investment in yourself to improve your life. This is exactly that."

**Step 5: Offer Payment Plan Immediately**
Reduce friction with split payments.
"We can break that down into very manageable monthly installments so it's less of an initial financial burden."

**Step 6: Guarantee as Safety Net**
Remove the risk entirely.
"Worst case scenario — you get your money back. Your actual worst case is you're in the same situation you're in right now."

## Objection Type 6: I Need to Do Due Diligence

### Trigger Phrases to Detect
- "I want to see what else is out there"
- "I need to do my research"
- "I'm looking at a few options"
- "Let me compare this to other programs"
- "I just want to do my due diligence"

### Real Example
Samuel says: "I have to do my due diligence, if I say it that way." And: "That's about it. It's just see what else is out there."
Context: Samuel is a rational, analytical buyer with a successful business. He has no emotional pain to leverage. This is a purely logical objection.

### Handling Sequence

**Step 1: Respect and Validate**
Do not push back on rationality.
"Yeah, of course. Totally understand that."

**Step 2: Get Specific About What They Need**
Find out their decision criteria.
"What is it that you need to see in order to make your decision?"

**Step 3: Surface Competitors**
Understand who else they are evaluating.
"What's the other options you're looking at at the moment?"

**Step 4: Positioning and Differentiation**
Emphasize what makes this offer different.
- One-on-one mentorship versus generic course
- Personalized strategy tailored to their niche
- Limited spots creating real scarcity
- Specific student results in their industry

**Step 5: Set Follow-Up Structure**
If they will not close today, book a specific follow-up date. Do not leave it open-ended. Send mobile, email, and relevant testimonial links.

### Important Note
This objection is the hardest to overcome on the call because it is rational, not emotional. Best handled with strong value differentiation during the pitch in Stage 4 so it rarely surfaces at all.
