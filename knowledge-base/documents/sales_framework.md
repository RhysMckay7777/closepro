# Sales Call Framework — 5-Stage Structure

## Stage 1: Frame Setting and Time Lock

### Purpose
Establish authority, lock time commitment, prevent early exits, and check for decision-makers before proceeding.

### Opening Script Pattern

**Confirm Connection**
- "Can you hear me and see me all good?"
- "No worries, no worries."

**Time Lock**
- "These calls tend to go for about an hour long. Are we good on time without any distractions or constraints for that?"
- "We've booked in for 16 minutes. Is that still a good timeframe for you?"
- "Let's dive in because we want to use our time respectfully. So are you still good for the hour?"

**Agenda Frame**
- "What I've seen works best on these calls is to start, I do just kind of want to find out a little bit more about you by asking some questions."
- "The purpose being that I want to find out exactly where you're at right now, and then where it is you'd like to go."
- "The main purpose of this call is to take a deep dive into where you are right now with your current situation."

**Qualify and Disqualify Frame**
- "You've probably seen from Jack's content that we have helped a lot of people, but there are some people that we can't necessarily help. And I hope you understand that."
- "We can only take a certain number of people on board because it is one-on-one mentorship, but we'd only look at that if everything feels aligned and we genuinely think we can help."

**Decision Maker Check**
- "Will we need anybody else on this call before a decision can be made, or is this just all for yourself?"
- This must happen in Stage 1 to prevent the partner objection later.

**Conditional Pitch Promise**
- "If I'm 100% confident by the end of our conversation that what we do here can actually help you, then I'd be more than happy to run through all the mentorship's details top to bottom."

### Transition to Stage 2
- "Sweet. Well, let's just start off with — what's the biggest reason that you're wanting to grow and get into online coaching now then?"
- "So what was the main motivation behind getting the course and looking at making money online?"

---

## Stage 2: Discovery and Situation Mapping

### Purpose
Understand the prospect's current reality including job, income, family, history, and what led them to book the call.

### Core Discovery Questions

**Motivation Question**
- "What is the biggest reason you are wanting to get into [online coaching / affiliate marketing / fix your relationship] right now?"
- "What led you to book the call?"

**Background and Duration**
- "How long have you been doing [current job/situation]?"
- "What was it that made you quit in January?"
- "How long have you felt unhappy in what you do?"

**Trigger Event**
- "Was there a specific moment that shifted things for you?"
- "When did you first recognize that was an issue?"

**Previous Attempts**
- "Have you actually ever looked into other mentorships before or anything like this?"
- "Have you tried anything to fix this before?"

**Income Anchoring**
- "How much would you need to be making so that we can replace the income that your corporate role was giving?"
- "What would be the amount of money per month so you could say to yourself, okay, I'm comfortable now, I can quit?"
- Always get a specific number. Pin them to a monthly figure.

**Timeline**
- "What's the timeline? How quickly do you want to get to that number?"

### Mirroring Technique
Reflect back what they say to build rapport and confirm understanding.
- "So you've got the vision to obviously propel his career forward with this in essence."
- "So it's having a bit of a strain on that side of things as well."
- "So it sounds like the actual job you have is not allowing you to do that."

### Transition to Stage 3
- "And obviously, is it okay if I'm just a little bit direct with you?"
- "So what do you think has actually stopped you from going out of your way to get the knowledge or mentorship you needed?"

---

## Stage 3: Pain Amplification and Emotional Anchoring

### Purpose
Deepen emotional investment by surfacing the real cost of inaction, connecting pain to identity, and creating urgency. This is the longest and most critical stage.

### Technique 1: Root Cause Dig
Ask what has truly held them back. Go beyond surface answers.
- "In today's day and age, you can get knowledge at the drop of a hat. So what do you think has actually stopped you from going out of your way to get the knowledge or mentorship you needed?"
- "Why do you think you didn't take action back then?"
- "Why now specifically? Because you've obviously let that comfortability hold you back for a very long time."

### Technique 2: Emotional Cost Question
Ask how the situation has affected them emotionally, not just financially.
- "How does that make you feel, knowing that you've missed out on that progress because you allowed that comfortability to have that hold on you?"
- "What do you feel like that has cost you over the past year?" — clarify you mean emotionally, not just dollar amount.
- "How does that affect your emotional well-being day to day?"
- "Has it just been for the past year that you've kind of felt that tension in yourself?"

### Technique 3: Cost of Inaction and Negative Future Pacing
Paint a vivid picture of what happens if they do nothing.
- "What happens if you don't take action and you continue going through this cycle like we have been over the last 10 years? How's your life going to look?"
- "If five, ten, twenty years go by and you're in the same situation as today — what does that look like?"
- "Would you settle for that outcome?"
- "If that was to happen, are you the type of person that would settle for that?"

### Technique 4: Positive Future Pacing
Paint the aspirational picture once pain is established.
- "Let's say you're making 10,000 a month, every month — that's 120,000 a year, 1.2 million over the next 10 years. How would that change things for you?"
- "When you're able to afford the new apartment, drive the nicer car, finally make more money — how will that make you feel?"
- "What does getting to that position do for you personally?"

### Technique 5: Identity Confrontation
Force them to declare which version of themselves they choose.
- "Are you someone who's going to let those doubts creep in and hold you back again? Or are you someone who's 100% committed and ready to push forward?"
- "Are you going to allow those things to stop you from getting what you truly want? Or give you more fire and drive?"
- "Do you feel like you are at this point willing to make a different decision?"
- "The doubts are going to show up. The difference is what you choose to do when they do."

### Technique 6: Metaphors and Stories
Use these to make abstract concepts tangible.

**Julius Caesar Burning the Boats**
"When he sailed out with the Roman armies, when they landed on the shores, the army they were facing was way bigger. Caesar burned their ships and said, 'We can't go back now. You either fight and win or you die.' And the Romans won."

**Angel vs Devil**
"There's two voices in your head. The angel is telling you go for it. The devil is saying stay comfortable, look more into it. Every time you've wanted to make that jump, you've let the devil win. And every time the devil wins, the louder that voice gets."

**Driving Analogy**
"When you get in the car you don't think, 'I'm not going to drive today because what if I crash.' You just get in and do it. Because if you thought like that, you'd never get to where you want to go."

**Gym Analogy**
"The business model works. It's like the gym. There's people that go to the gym that are really in shape and people that aren't. Does that mean the gym doesn't work? No. It just means the belief in themselves to commit."

**Tiger in a Cage**
"You're always going to be worried about that tiger until you deal with the tiger in the cage."

**House on Quicksand**
"You're going to build blades of bricks on quicksand. We want to get rid of all that mud and sludge, clear the path, clean, healthy, strong, and then start building."

### Commitment Extraction Before Pitch
Get verbal buy-in before transitioning to the pitch.
- "Do you feel as though you're now at a point where you are prepared to totally let go of that comfortability?"
- "Would you like our help with that then?"
- Expected answer: "Yeah" — this triggers transition to Stage 4.

### Transition to Stage 4
- "Amazing. So how about I take you through how I see the mentorship working for yourself?"
- "So how about I take you through everything?"

## Stage 5: Close and Objection Handling

### Purpose
Present price, offer payment plans, handle objections in real time, and secure commitment.

### Price Reveal Pattern
Always reveal price after the full value build. State it matter-of-factly, then immediately offer a payment plan.
- "The overall investment is 3.5K but we can break that down into very manageable monthly installments."
- "The exact price is 1,919 USD."
- "That amount comes to 4,900 for the full 12 weeks."
- "If you want to do a year long coaching, it's 14,900. There is another option where it is three months, and that is 4,900."

### Payment Plan Options
Always have multiple options ready to reduce friction.
- Full upfront — the anchor price.
- Two payments split in half — "You pay half now and the remaining in 30 days."
- Three monthly payments — "1,633 times three payments."
- Extended monthly installments — for higher ticket offers.

### If Prospect Says Yes
Book the next step immediately. Do not leave it open.
- "I'll book you into a quick 15-minute meet and greet with the coach."
- Send payment link while still on the call.
- "Let's not let the fear creep back in."

### If Prospect Objects
Reference the Objection Playbook for specific handling sequences based on objection type.

### Final Commitment Phrases
- "The hardest part of change isn't the actual work itself — it's the decision you make as to whether you do the work or not."
- "What you can guarantee yourself is — can you guarantee yourself that you're going to put in the work no matter what?"
- "Let's not let the fear creep back in and the thoughts drown us."
- "Who's responsibility is it to actually put in the work? Yours. And we'll be with you every step of the way."
